	volume = {18},

	url = {http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014HESS...18.3907S},
	doi = {10.5194/hess-18-3907-2014},
	abstract = {The increasing food and water demands of East Africa's growing 
population are stressing the region's inconsistent water resources and
rain-fed agriculture. More accurate seasonal agricultural drought
forecasts for this region can inform better water and agropastoral
management decisions, support optimal allocation of the region's water
resources, and mitigate socioeconomic losses incurred by droughts and
floods. Here we describe the development and implementation of a
seasonal agricultural drought forecast system for East Africa ({EA}) that
provides decision support for the Famine Early Warning Systems Network's
({FEWS} {NET}) science team. We evaluate this forecast system for a region
of equatorial {EA} (2° S-8° N, 36-46° E) for the
March-April-May ({MAM}) growing season. This domain encompasses one of the
most food-insecure, climatically variable, and socioeconomically
vulnerable regions in {EA}, and potentially the world; this region has
experienced famine as recently as 2011. To produce an
"agricultural outlook", our forecast system simulates soil moisture ({SM})
scenarios using the Variable Infiltration Capacity ({VIC}) hydrologic
model forced with climate scenarios describing the upcoming season.
First, we forced the {VIC} model with high-quality atmospheric
observations to produce baseline soil moisture ({SM}) estimates (here
after referred as {SM} a posteriori estimates). These compared favorably
(correlation = 0.75) with the water requirement satisfaction index
({WRSI}), an index that the {FEWS} {NET} uses to estimate crop yields. Next,
we evaluated the {SM} forecasts generated by this system on 5 March and 5
April of each year between 1993 and 2012 by comparing them with the
corresponding {SM} a posteriori estimates. We found that initializing {SM}
forecasts with start-of-season ({SOS}) (5 March) {SM} conditions resulted in
useful {SM} forecast skill ({\textgreater} 0.5 correlation) at 1-month and, in some
cases, 3-month lead times. Similarly, when the forecast was initialized
with midseason (i.e., 5 April) {SM} conditions, the skill of forecasting
{SM} estimates until the end-of-season improved (correlation {\textgreater} 0.5 over
several grid cells). We also found these {SM} forecasts to be more
skillful than the ones generated using the Ensemble Streamflow
Prediction ({ESP}) method, which derives its hydrologic forecast skill
solely from the knowledge of the initial hydrologic conditions. Finally,
we show that, in terms of forecasting spatial patterns of {SM} anomalies,
the skill of this agricultural drought forecast system is generally
greater ({\textgreater} 0.8 correlation) during drought years (when standardized
anomaly of {MAM} precipitation is below 0). This indicates that this
system might be particularity useful for identifying drought events in
this region and can support decision-making for mitigation or
humanitarian assistance.},

A model was developed, based on previously documented common-pool resource experiments, and simulated using the Swarm multi-agent simulation environment. Agents in these models were designed to represent the actions of the individual appropriators in the experiments and the common-pool resource itself. The intelligent agents developed for these simulations possess adaptive capabilities. They select amongst alternative strategies the one that appears to yield the best performance under current conditions. Simulations of this model rendered observations of some potential relationships between individual action and group performance in common-pool resource experimental situations. In particular, adaptive agents generated group level behaviour with similar performance characteristics to groups in actual experiments. Some potential future directions for this research, and possible applications in natural resources management, are discussed.},

	title = {Genetic Algorithms for the Exploration of Parameter Spaces in Agent-based Models},
	abstract = {This work provides the first comprehensive investigation of the use of genetic algorithms for exploring the range of behaviors produced by agent-based models. Agent-based modeling ({ABM}) is a powerful computer simulation technique in which many agents interact according to simple rules resulting in the emergence of complex aggregate-level behavior. However, as {ABM} is increasingly employed in both natural and social sciences, the methods and tools for understanding, exploring, and analyzing the behavior of agent-based models have not kept pace. In particular, models may be characterized by a large number of parameters, and the task of discovering parameter settings for which a model will produce a certain behavior is both difficult and time-consuming. Genetic algorithms ({GAs}) offer a flexible metaheuristic search mechanism which has previously been successful in a variety of combinatorial optimization and search problems. There is a rich space of possible model exploration tasks, and we offer a new unified framework for the creation and application of quantitative measures to perform these tasks using an evolutionary-search paradigm. We demonstrate the utility of {GAs} for {ABM} parameter exploration through a sequence of case studies in various application domains, including behavioral biology, viral marketing, archeology, and web-based journalism. This work advances agent-based modeling methodology by exploring when and how {GAs} can be useful in the model development and analysis process. It also contributes to a deeper understanding of {GAs}, by evaluating their strengths and weaknesses with regard to the particular challenges posed by this problem domain. We develop novel heuristics for dealing with model stochasticity in conjunction with fitness caching techniques. We also present the first set of benchmark models/tasks for automated {ABM} parameter search and exploration, and we rigorously investigate the performance of {GAs} on these benchmarks, with varying levels of stochasticity. An important product of this research is {BehaviorSearch}, a new automated software tool for efficient exploration of {ABM} parameter spaces. The design and affordances of {BehaviorSearch} are discussed with respect to improving model exploration and analysis by {ABM} practitioners.},

	abstract = {This book introduces one of the most powerful tools of modern economics to a wide audience: those who will later construct or consume game-theoretic models. Robert Gibbons addresses scholars in applied fields within economics who want a serious and thorough discussion of game theory but who may have found other works overly abstract. Gibbons emphasizes the economic applications of the theory at least as much as the pure theory itself; formal arguments about abstract games play a minor role. The applications illustrate the process of model building-of translating an informal description of a multi-person decision situation into a formal game-theoretic problem to be analyzed. Also, the variety of applications shows that similar issues arise in different areas of economics, and that the same game-theoretic tools can be applied in each setting. In order to emphasize the broad potential scope of the theory, conventional applications from industrial organization have been largely replaced by applications from labor, macro, and other applied fields in economics. The book covers four classes of games, and four corresponding notions of equilibrium: static games of complete information and Nash equilibrium, dynamic games of complete information and subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium, static games of incomplete information and Bayesian Nash equilibrium, and dynamic games of incomplete information and perfect Bayesian equilibrium.},

	title = {Introducing Monte Carlo Methods with R},
	isbn = {978-1-4419-1575-7},
	abstract = {Computational techniques based on simulation have now become an essential part of the statistician's toolbox. It is thus crucial to provide statisticians with a practical understanding of those methods, and there is no better way to develop intuition and skills for simulation than to use simulation to solve statistical problems. Introducing Monte Carlo Methods with R covers the main tools used in statistical simulation from a programmer's point of view, explaining the R implementation of each simulation technique and providing the output for better understanding and comparison. While this book constitutes a comprehensive treatment of simulation methods, the theoretical justification of those methods has been considerably reduced, compared with Robert and Casella (2004). Similarly, the more exploratory and less stable solutions are not covered here. This book does not require a preliminary exposure to the R programming language or to Monte Carlo methods, nor an advanced mathematical background. While many examples are set within a Bayesian framework, advanced expertise in Bayesian statistics is not required. The book covers basic random generation algorithms, Monte Carlo techniques for integration and optimization, convergence diagnoses, Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, including Metropolis \{Hastings and Gibbs algorithms, and adaptive algorithms. All chapters include exercises and all R programs are available as an R package called mcsm. The book appeals to anyone with a practical interest in simulation methods but no previous exposure. It is meant to be useful for students and practitioners in areas such as statistics, signal processing, communications engineering, control theory, econometrics, finance and more. The programming parts are introduced progressively to be accessible to any reader.},

How much can {CEO}’s impact the performance of their companies? And does higher pay incentivize people to work hard?If you think the answers to these questions are a matter of common sense, think again. As sociologist and network science pioneer Duncan Watts explains in this provocative book, the explanations that we give for the outcomes that we observe in life—explanation that seem obvious once we know the answer—are less useful than they seem.Drawing on the latest scientific research, along with a wealth of historical and contemporary examples, Watts shows how common sense reasoning and history conspire to mislead us into believing that we understand more about the world of human behavior than we do; and in turn, why attempts to predict, manage, or manipulate social and economic systems so often go awry.It seems obvious, for example, that people respond to incentives; yet policy makers and managers alike frequently fail to anticipate how people will respond to the incentives they create. Social trends often seem to have been driven by certain influential people; yet marketers have been unable to identify these “influencers” in advance. And although successful products or companies always seem in retrospect to have succeeded because of their unique qualities, predicting the qualities of the next hit product or hot company is notoriously difficult even for experienced professionals.Only by understanding how and when common sense fails, Watts argues, can we improve how we plan for the future, as well as understand the present—an argument that has important implications in politics, business, and marketing, as well as in science and everyday life.},

	abstract = {During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation and information technology. With it have come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It is a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting---the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book. This major new edition features many topics not covered in the original, including graphical models, random forests, ensemble methods, least angle regression \& path algorithms for the lasso, non-negative matrix factorization, and spectral clustering. There is also a chapter on methods for ``wide'' data (p bigger than n), including multiple testing and false discovery rates.},

This software individual, or "agent," is endowed with distinct emotional/affective, cognitive/deliberative, and social modules. Grounded in contemporary neuroscience, these internal components interact to generate observed, often far-from-rational, individual behavior. When multiple agents of this new type move and interact spatially, they collectively generate an astonishing range of dynamics spanning the fields of social conflict, psychology, public health, law, network science, and economics.Epstein weaves a computational tapestry with threads from Plato, Hume, Darwin, Pavlov, Smith, Tolstoy, Marx, James, and Dostoevsky, among others. This transformative synthesis of social philosophy, cognitive neuroscience, and agent-based modeling will fascinate scholars and students of every stripe. Epstein's computer programs are provided in the book or on its Princeton University Press website, along with movies of his "computational parables." Agent\_Zero is a signal departure in what it includes (e.g., a new synthesis of neurally grounded internal modules), what it eschews (e.g., standard behavioral imitation), the phenomena it generates (from genocide to financial panic), and the modeling arsenal it offers the scientific community. For generative social science, Agent\_Zero presents a groundbreaking vision and the tools to realize it.},

	abstract = {The Integrated Water Resources Management ({IWRM}) paradigm has been worldwide recognized as the only feasible way currently available to ensure a sustainable perspective in planning and managing water resource systems. It is the inspiring principle of the Water Framework Directive, adopted by the European Union in 2000, as well as the main reference for all the water related activity of {UNESCO} in the third world countries. However, very often, real world attempts of implementing {IWRM} fail for the lack of a systematic approach and the inadequacy of tools and techniques adopted to address the intrinsically complex nature of water systems. This book explores recent and important contributions of System Analysis and Control Theory to the technical application of such paradigm and to the improvement of its theoretical basis. Its prior aim is to demonstrate how the modelling and computational difficulties posed by this paradigm might be significantly reduced by strengthening the efficiency of the solution techniques, instead of weakening the integration requirements. The first introductory chapter provides the reader with a logical map of the book, by formalizing the {IWRM} paradigm in a nine-step decisional procedure and by identifying the points where the contribution of System Analysis and Control Theory is more useful. The book is then organized in three sections whose chapters analyze some theoretical and mathematical aspects of these contributions or presents design applications. The outstanding research issues on the border between System Analysis and {IWRM} is depicted in the last chapter, where a pull of scientists and experts, coordinated by Prof. Tony Jakeman describe the foreseeable scenario. The book is based on the most outstanding contributions to the {IFAC} workshop on Modelling and Control for Participatory Planning and Managing Water Systems held in Venice, September 28- October 1, 2004. That workshop has been conceived and organized with the explicit purpose of producing this book: the maximum length of the papers was unusually long (of the size of a book chapter) and only five long oral presentations were planned each day, thus allowing for a very useful and constructive discussion.- Contributions from the leading world specialists of the field - Integration of technical modelling aspects and participatory decision-making- Good compromise between theory and application},

The traditional approach to tackling this bias problem is cross-validation. The bootstrap is another way to bring down the high variability of cross-validation. But a direct comparison of the two estimators, cross-validation and bootstrap, is not fair because the latter estimator requires much heavier computation. We performed an empirical study to compare the .632+ bootstrap estimator with the repeated 10-fold cross-validation and the repeated one-third holdout estimator. All the estimators were set to require about the same amount of computation. In the simulation study, the repeated 10-fold cross-validation estimator was found to have better performance than the .632+ bootstrap estimator when the classifier is highly adaptive to the training sample. We have also found that the .632+ bootstrap estimator suffers from a bias problem for large samples as well as for small samples.},

	abstract = {In order to increase adaptive capacity and empower people to cope with their changing environment, it is imperative to develop decision-support tools that help people understand and respond to challenges and opportunities. Some such tools have emerged in response to social and economic shifts in light of anticipated climatic change. Climate change will play out at the local level, and adaptive behaviours will be influenced by local resources and knowledge. Community-based insights are essential building blocks for effective planning. However, in order to mainstream and scale up adaptation, it is useful to have mechanisms for evaluating the benefits and costs of candidate adaptation strategies. This article reviews relevant literature and presents an argument in favour of using various modelling tools directed at these considerations. The authors also provide evidence for the balancing of qualitative and quantitative elements in assessments of programme proposals considered for financing through mechanisms that have the potential to scale up effective adaptation, such as the Adaptation Fund under the Kyoto Protocol. The article concludes that it is important that researchers and practitioners maintain flexibility in their analyses, so that they are themselves adaptable, to allow communities to best manage the emerging challenges of climate change and the long-standing challenges of development.},

This review first summarizes {SB}. Then it summarizes a recent case study, namely, a supply-chain simulation with 92 factors where {SB} identifies a shortlist with 10 factors after simulating only 19 combinations.

Seven methods which can give the relative contribution and/or the contribution profile of the input factors were compared: (i) the ‘{PaD}’ (for Partial Derivatives) method consists in a calculation of the partial derivatives of the output according to the input variables; (ii) the ‘Weights’ method is a computation using the connection weights; (iii) the ‘Perturb’ method corresponds to a perturbation of the input variables; (iv) the ‘Profile’ method is a successive variation of one input variable while the others are kept constant at a fixed value; (v) the ‘classical stepwise’ method is an observation of the change in the error value when an adding (forward) or an elimination (backward) step of the input variables is operated; (vi) ‘Improved stepwise a’ uses the same principle as the classical stepwise, but the elimination of the input occurs when the network is trained, the connection weights corresponding to the input variable studied is also eliminated; (vii) ‘Improved stepwise b’ involves the network being trained and fixed step by step, one input variable at its mean value to note the consequences on the error. The data tested in this study concerns the prediction of the density of brown trout spawning redds using habitat characteristics. The {PaD} method was found to be the most useful as it gave the most complete results, followed by the Profile method that gave the contribution profile of the input variables. The Perturb method allowed a good classification of the input parameters as well as the Weights method that has been simplified but these two methods lack stability. Next came the two improved stepwise methods (a and b) that both gave exactly the same result but the contributions were not sufficiently expressed. Finally, the classical stepwise methods gave the poorest results.},

In this study of Aurora, Colorado, factors influencing residential water demand are reviewed during a turbulent drought period (2000-2005). Findings expand the understanding of residential demand in at least three salient ways: first, by documenting that pricing and outdoor water restriction policies interact with each other ensuring that total water savings are not additive of each program operating independently; second, by showing that the effectiveness of pricing and restrictions policies varies among different classes of customers (i.e., low, middle, and high volume water users) and between predrought and drought periods; and third, in demonstrating that real-time information about consumptive use (via the Water Smart Reader) helps customers reach water-use targets.},

	abstract = {Social dilemmas are situations in which collective interests are at odds with private interests: pollution, depletion of natural resources, and intergroup conflicts, are at their core social dilemmas. Because of their multidisciplinarity and their importance, social dilemmas have been studied by economists, biologists, psychologists, sociologists, and political scientists. These studies typically explain tendency to cooperation by dividing people in proself and prosocial types, or appealing to forms of external control or, in iterated social dilemmas, to long-term strategies. But recent experiments have shown that cooperation is possible even in one-shot social dilemmas without forms of external control and the rate of cooperation typically depends on the payoffs. This makes impossible a predictive division between proself and prosocial people and proves that people have attitude to cooperation by nature. The key innovation of this article is in fact to postulate that humans have attitude to cooperation by nature and consequently they do not act a priori as single agents, as assumed by standard economic models, but they forecast how a social dilemma would evolve if they formed coalitions and then they act according to their most optimistic forecast. Formalizing this idea we propose the first predictive model of human cooperation able to organize a number of different experimental findings that are not explained by the standard model. We show also that the model makes satisfactorily accurate quantitative predictions of population average behavior in one-shot social dilemmas.},

How much does education raise wages? Mostly Harmless Econometrics shows how the basic tools of applied econometrics allow the data to speak.

The term "total" here means that the factor's main effect, as well as all the interaction terms involving that factor, are included. Although computationally different, the very same measure of sensitivity is offered by the indices of Sobol'. The main advantages of the extended {FAST} are its robustness, especially at low sample size, and its computational efficiency. The computational aspects of the extended {FAST} are described. These include (1) the definition of new sets of parametric equations for the search-curve exploring the input space, (2) the selection of frequencies for the parametric equations, and (3) the procedure adopted to estimate the total contributions. We also address the limitations of other global {SA} methods and suggest that the total-effect indices are ideally suited to perform a global, quantitative, model-independent sensitivity analysis.},

	title = {Posterior Predictive Assessment of Model Fitness Via Realized Discrepancies},
	abstract = {Abstract: This paper considers Bayesian counterparts of the classical tests for goodness of fit and their use in judging the fit of a single Bayesian model to the observed data. We focus on posterior predictive assessment, in a framework that also includes conditioning on auxiliary statistics. The Bayesian formulation facilitates the construction and calculation of a meaningful reference distribution not only for any (classical) statistic, but also for any parameter-dependent “statistic ” or discrepancy. The latter allows us to propose the realized discrepancy assessment of model fitness, which directly measures the true discrepancy between data and the posited model, for any aspect of the model which we want to explore. The computation required for the realized discrepancy assessment is a straightforward byproduct of the posterior simulation used for the original Bayesian analysis. We illustrate with three applied examples. The first example, which serves mainly to motivate the work, illustrates the difficulty of classical tests in assessing the fitness of a Poisson model to a positron emission tomography image that is constrained to be nonnegative. The second and third examples illustrate the details of the posterior predictive approach in two problems: estimation in a model with inequality constraints on the parameters, and estimation in a mixture model. In all three examples, standard test statistics (either a χ 2 or a likelihood ratio) are not pivotal: the difficulty is not just how to compute the reference distribution for the test, but that in the classical framework no such distribution exists, independent of the unknown model parameters. Key words and phrases: Bayesian p-value, χ 2 test, discrepancy, graphical assessment, mixture model, model criticism, posterior predictive p-value, prior predictive},

	abstract = {We propose a new method for approximate Bayesian statistical inference on the basis of summary statistics. The method is suited to complex problems that arise in population genetics, extending ideas developed in this setting by earlier authors. Properties of the posterior distribution of a parameter, such as its mean or density curve, are approximated without explicit likelihood calculations. This is achieved by fitting a local-linear regression of simulated parameter values on simulated summary statistics, and then substituting the observed summary statistics into the regression equation. The method combines many of the advantages of Bayesian statistical inference with the computational efficiency of methods based on summary statistics. A key advantage of the method is that the nuisance parameters are automatically integrated out in the simulation step, so that the large numbers of nuisance parameters that arise in population genetics problems can be handled without difficulty. Simulation results indicate computational and statistical efficiency that compares favorably with those of alternative methods previously proposed in the literature. We also compare the relative efficiency of inferences obtained using methods based on summary statistics with those obtained directly from the data using {MCMC}.},

The methodology described in this paper is a simulation-optimization process where the qualitative variables and the structure of the system are the subjects of optimization. Here, the optimum response sought is a function of design and operation characteristics of the system such as the type of machines to use, dispatching rules, sequence of processing operations, etc. In the methodology developed here simulation models are automatically generated through an object-oriented process and are evaluated for various candidate configurations of the system. These candidates are suggested by a Genetic Algorithm ({GA}) that automatically guides the system towards better solutions. After simulating the alternatives, the results are returned to the {GA} to be utilized in selection of the next generation of configurations to be evaluated. This process continues until a satisfactory solution is obtained for the system.},

Between the present and when a combination of sea-level rise and erosion renders these areas uninhabitable, communities must choose levels of defensive expenditures to reduce risks and individual residents must assess whether and when risk levels are unacceptably high to justify investment in housing. We model the dynamics of coastal adaptation as the interplay of underlying climatic risks, collective actions to mitigate those risks, and individual risk assessments based on beliefs in model predictions and processing of past climate events. Efforts linking physical and behavioural models to explore shoreline dynamics have not yet brought together this set of essential factors. We couple a barrier-island model with an agent-based model of real-estate markets to show that, relative to people with low belief in model predictions about climate change, informed property owners invest heavily in defensive expenditures in the near term and then abandon coastal real estate at some critical risk threshold that presages a period of significant price volatility.},

	abstract = {In this work we demonstrate that the combination of agent-based modeling and simulation constitutes a useful methodological approach to dealing with the complexity derived from multiple factors with influence in the domestic water management in emergent metropolitan areas. In particular, we adapt and integrate different social submodels, models of urban dynamics, water consumption, and technological and opinion diffusion, in an agent-based model that is, in turn, linked with a geographic information system. The result is a computational environment that enables simulating and comparing various water demand scenarios. We have parameterized our general model for the metropolitan area of Valladolid (Spain).The model shows the influence of urban dynamics (e.g., intrapopulation movements, residence typology, and changes in the territorial model) and other socio-geographic effects (technological and opinion dynamics) in domestic water demand. The conclusions drawn in this way would have been difficult to obtain using other approaches, such as conventional forecasting methods, given the need to integrate different socioeconomic and geographic aspects in one single model. We illustrate that the described methodology can complement conventional approaches, providing descriptive and formal additional insights into domestic water demand management problems.},

Externalities occur when individuals make decisions that harm others, without concern for the impact or feeling a need to compensate for the harm. The aim of this study was to investigate whether {PE} affects people's motivation to conserve water, and, consequently, the practice of residential water consumption. Two hundred eighty Mexican citizens responded to a questionnaire investigating how they perceived that other individuals in their community wasted water. Respondents were also asked about their motives to conserve water, and direct observations of individual water consumption were recorded. Results were processed within a structural equations model, which revealed that motives to conserve water significantly inhibit water consumption. Since the perception of externalities also inhibits conservation motives, the resulting effect of {PE} on water consumption is positive. This result means that the more people perceive that others waste water, the less their conservation motives, and, therefore, the more their own water consumption.},

	abstract = {This research investigates the role of the level, structure, and rate of change of water prices, as well as non-price policies and socio-demographic characteristics on households' decision-making regarding indoor and outdoor water conservation practices. In this paper, indoor water conservation choices refer to the presence/absence of low volume toilets and low flow showers in the home. Outdoor water conservation choices refer to the frequency of lawn and garden watering by the household during summer months. The former is estimated with a bivariate probit model, while the latter requires an ordered bi-variate probit model. The data come from Statistics Canada's 2006 Households and the Environment Survey. It provides a national cross-sectional sample of household-level observations on indoor and outdoor water choices. These data are linked to municipal level information on residential water prices, non-price water conservation policies, and weather information assembled by the authors. Potential endogeneity arising from the presence of price and non-price water policy variables is investigated using a simultaneous equations approach. Estimation results provide several insights. First, water prices and household characteristics play important roles in shaping household decision-making regarding both indoor and outdoor water conservation. Second, there is little evidence that non-price water conservation policies influence either indoor or outdoor decision-making. Third, there is evidence of correlation for the two indoor water-conserving choices and also for the frequency of lawn and garden watering decisions. Finally, there is no evidence of endogeneity of water prices and other policy variables.},

The large and nonrandom error component makes self-reports questionable as a proxy for objective measures of overall water savings in conservation research.

	abstract = {Behavioral Economics is the combination of psychology and economics that investigates what happens in markets in which some of the agents display human limitations and complications.  We begin with a preliminary question about relevance.  Does some combination of market forces, learning and evolution render these human qualities irrelevant?  No.  Because of limits of arbitrage less than perfect agents survive and influence market outcomes.  We then discuss three important ways in which humans deviate from the standard economic model.  Bounded rationality reflects the limited cognitive abilities that constrain human problem solving.  Bounded willpower captures the fact that people sometimes make choices that are not in their long-run interest.  Bounded self-interest incorporates the comforting fact that humans are often willing to sacrifice their own interests to help others.  We then illustrate how these concepts can be applied in two settings: finance and savings.  Financial markets have greater arbitrage opportunities than other markets, so behavioral factors might be thought to be less important here, but we show that even here the limits of arbitrage create anomalies that the psychology of decision making helps explain.  Since saving for retirement requires both complex calculations and willpower, behavioral factors are essential elements of any complete descriptive theory.},

However, the well-established statistical method of empirical likelihood provides another route to such settings that bypasses simulations from the model and the choices of the approximate Bayesian computation parameters (summary statistics, distance, tolerance), while being convergent in the number of observations. Furthermore, bypassing model simulations may lead to significant time savings in complex models, for instance those found in population genetics. The Bayesian computation with empirical likelihood algorithm we develop in this paper also provides an evaluation of its own performance through an associated effective sample size. The method is illustrated using several examples, including estimation of standard distributions, time series, and population genetics models.},

	abstract = {With advanced computer technology, systems are getting larger to fulfill more complicated tasks: however, they are also becoming less reliable. Consequently, testing is an indispensable part of system design and implementation; yet it has proved to be a formidable task for complex systems. This motivates the study of testing finite stare machines to ensure the correct functioning of systems and to discover aspects of their behavior. A finite state machine contains a finite number of states and produces outputs on state transitions after receiving inputs. Finite state machines are widely used to model systems in diverse areas, including sequential circuits, certain types of programs, and, more recently, communication protocols. In a testing problem we have a machine about which we lack some information; we would like to deduce this information by providing a sequence of inputs to the machine and observing the outputs produced. Because of its practical importance and theoretical interest, the problem of testing finite state machines has been studied in different areas and at various times. The earliest published literature on this topic dates back to the 1950's. Activities in the 1960's mid early 1970's were motivated mainly by automata theory and sequential circuit testing. The area seemed to have mostly died down until a few years ago when the testing problem was resurrected and is now being studied anew due to its applications to conformance testing of communication protocols. While some old problems which had been open for decades were resolved recently, new concepts and more intriguing problems from new applications emerge. We review the fundamental problems in testing finite state machines and techniques for solving these problems, tracing progress in the area from its inception to the present and the stare of the art. In addition, we discuss extensions of finite state machines and some other topics related to testing},

In order to study the pressure-based approach out in the wild, we deployed a ground truth sensor network for five weeks in three homes and two apartments that directly monitored valve-level water usage by fixtures and appliances. We use this data to, first, demonstrate the practical challenges in constructing water usage activity inference algorithms and, second, to inform the design of a new probabilistic-based classification approach. Inspired by algorithms in speech recognition, our novel Bayesian approach incorporates template matching, a language model, grammar, and prior probabilities. We show that with a single pressure sensor, our probabilistic algorithm can classify real-world water usage at the fixture level with 90\% accuracy and at the fixturecategory level with 96\% accuracy. With two pressure sensors, these accuracies increase to 94\% and 98\%. Finally, we show how our new approach can be trained with fewer examples than a strict template-matching approach alone.},

Here, machine learning markets for multivariate systems are defined, and a utility-based framework is established for their analysis. This differs from the usual approach of defining static betting functions. It is shown that such markets can implement model combination methods used in machine learning, such as product of expert and mixture of expert approaches as equilibrium pricing models, by varying agent utility functions. They can also implement models composed of local potentials, and message passing methods. Prediction markets also allow for more flexible combinations, by combining multiple different utility functions. Conversely, the market mechanisms implement inference in the relevant probabilistic models. This means that market mechanism can be utilized for implementing parallelized model building and inference for probabilistic modelling.},

The {MR} principle of linear modelling often gives low performance when relationships between variables are nonlinear; this is often the case in ecology; some variables must therefore be transformed. Despite these manipulations, the results often remain disappointing: poor prediction, dependence of residuals on the variable to predict. On the other hand {NN} are nonlinear type models. They do not necessitate transformation of variables and can give better results. The application of these two techniques to a set of ecological data (study of the relationship between density of brown trout spawning sites (redds) and habitat characteristics), shows that {NN} are clearly more performant than {MR} (R2 = 0.96 vs R2 = 0.47 or R2 = 0.72 in raw variables or nonlinear transformed variables). With the calculation power now currently available, {NN} are easy to implement and can thus be recommended for modelling of a number ecological processes.},

One of the primary obstacles to understanding the computational underpinnings of biological vision is its sheer scale—the visual system is a massively parallel computer, comprised of billions of elements. While this scale has historically been beyond the reach of even the fastest super-computing systems, recent advances in commodity graphics processors (such as those found in the {PlayStation} 3 and high-end {NVIDIA} graphics cards) have made unprecedented computational resources broadly available. Here, we describe a high-throughput approach that harnesses the power of modern graphics hardware to search a vast space of large-scale, biologically inspired candidate models of the visual system. The best of these models, drawn from thousands of candidates, outperformed a variety of state-of-the-art vision systems across a range of object and face recognition tasks. We argue that these experiments point a new way forward, both in the creation of machine vision systems and in providing insights into the computational underpinnings of biological vision.},

Though such models are well-established in behavioural psychology, only recently have they begun to receive attention in game theory and its applications to economics and politics. This paper provides an informal overview of a range of such theories applied to repeated interaction games. We describe different models of aspiration formation: where (1) aspirations are fixed but required to be consistent with longrun average payoffs; (2) aspirations evolve based on past personal experience or of previous generations of players; and (3) aspirations are based on the experience of peers. Convergence to non-Nash outcomes may result in either of these formulations. Indeed, cooperative behaviour can emerge and survive in the long run, even though it may be a strictly dominated strategy in the stage game, and despite the myopic adaptation of stage game strategies. Differences between reinforcement learning and evolutionary game theory are also discussed.},

This paper proposes to infer causal impact on the basis of a diffusion-regression state-space model that predicts the counterfactual market response in a synthetic control that would have occurred had no intervention taken place. In contrast to classical difference-in-differences schemes, state-space models make it possible to (i) infer the temporal evolution of attributable impact, (ii) incorporate empirical priors on the parameters in a fully Bayesian treatment, and (iii) flexibly accommodate multiple sources of variation, including local trends, seasonality and the time-varying influence of contemporaneous covariates. Using a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for posterior inference, we illustrate the statistical properties of our approach on simulated data. We then demonstrate its practical utility by estimating the causal effect of an online advertising campaign on search-related site visits. We discuss the strengths and limitations of state-space models in enabling causal attribution in those settings where a randomised experiment is unavailable. The {CausalImpact} R package provides an implementation of our approach.},

	abstract = {In regular statistical models, the leave-one-out cross-validation is asymptotically equivalent to the Akaike information criterion. However, since many learning machines are singular statistical models, the asymptotic behavior of the cross-validation remains unknown. In previous studies, we established the singular learning theory and proposed a widely applicable information criterion, the expectation value of which is asymptotically equal to the average Bayes generalization loss. In the present paper, we theoretically compare the Bayes cross-validation loss and the widely applicable information criterion and prove two theorems. First, the Bayes cross-validation loss is asymptotically equivalent to the widely applicable information criterion as a random variable. Therefore, model selection and hyperparameter optimization using these two values are asymptotically equivalent. Second, the sum of the Bayes generalization error and the Bayes cross-validation error is asymptotically equal to 2λ/n, where λ is the real log canonical threshold and n is the number of training samples. Therefore the relation between the cross-validation error and the generalization error is determined by the algebraic geometrical structure of a learning machine. We also clarify that the deviance information criteria are different from the Bayes cross-validation and the widely applicable information criterion.},

The results are used to generate a network of water management institutions that reflect public perceptions of water management and the structure of water management in these areas. This structure can be highly centralized or fragmented; in the latter case, multiple peer institutions exist that may cooperate or be in conflict. This is reflected in the public discourse of the water consumers in these areas and can, we contend, impact the potential responses of management agencies to challenges of water supply and quality and, in some cases, limit their effectiveness. Flagstaff, {AZ}, Tucson, {AZ}, Las Vegas, {NV}, and the Grand Valley, {CO}, are examined, including more than 110,000 articles from  2004–2012. Documents are scored by association with water topics, and phrases likely to be institutions are extracted via custom {NLP} and {NER} algorithms; those institutions associated with water-related documents are used to form networks via document  co-location. The Grand Valley is shown to have a markedly different structure, which we contend reflects the different historical trajectory of its development and its current state, which includes multiple institutions of roughly equal scope and size. These results demonstrate the utility of using {NLP} and {NER} methods to understanding the structure and variation of water management systems.},

Forecast of vegetation anomalies at 1–3 months lead time can help in decision making. Here we show that normalized difference vegetation index ({NDVI}) along with other hydroclimatic variables (soil moisture and sea surface temperature) can be effectively used to predict vegetation anomalies in India. The spatiotemporal analysis of {NDVI} showed significant greening over the region during the period of 1982–2013. The root-zone soil moisture showed a positive correlation with {NDVI}, whereas the El Niño–Southern Oscillation index (Nino 3.4) is negatively correlated in most of the regions. We extended this relationship to develop a model to predict {NDVI} in 1 to 3 months lead time. The predicted vegetation anomalies compare well with observations, which can be effectively utilized in early warning and better planning in water resources and agricultural sectors in India.},

	abstract = {With the 1954 publication of his Foundations of Statistics, in which he proposed a basis that takes into account not only strictly objective and repetitive events, but also vagueness and interpersonal differences, Leonard J. Savage opened the greatest controversy in modern statistical thought. His theory of the foundations, connected with the personalistic interpretation of probability, challenged the then dominant frequentist school.In the first seven chapters of his book, Professor Savage is concerned with the foundations at a relatively deep level. To explain and defend his theory of the behavior of a highly idealized person faced with uncertainty, he considers decision making, the sure-thing principle, qualitative and quantitative personal probability, the approach to certainty through experience, symmetric sequences of events, critical comments on personal probability, utility, observations as they affect the decision, and partition problems. In chapters eight through seventeen he discusses statistics proper — the actual devices of the discipline — from the personalistic view. He concentrates on minimax problems and on the theories of estimation and testing. Exercises are included throughout to reinforce and supplement the text. The mathematical techniques used are quite elementary, some calculus and elementary probability theory being presupposed. Understanding of all the material calls for some mathematical maturity on the part of the reader.Professor Savage had reevaluated his position somewhat during the decade and a half since the work was first published. While reaffirming the material in the first seven chapters, he had reconsidered the appropriateness of many frequentistic applications. To explain these recent developments, he added a new preface, new footnotes, and a supplementary 180-item, annotated bibliography. Because of Professor Savage's death, the revisions that he made for this edition are his final analysis of the situation.As he says on page one, "the foundations are the most controversial parts of many, if not all, sciences." In statistics, the foundation of probability is "as controversial a subject as one could name." In 1954, the controversy was very great, and although it has quieted since, the problem has yet to be resolved. A new generation of readers who have missed Savage's analysis have here an opportunity to study firsthand what his important foundation of statistics — personal probability — is, and what it means to statistical thought.},

We have systematically evaluated existing uses of the {ODD} protocol and identified, as expected, parts of {ODD} needing improvement and clarification. Accordingly, we revise the definition of {ODD} to clarify aspects of the original version and thereby facilitate future standardization of {ABM} descriptions. We discuss frequently raised critiques in {ODD} but also two emerging, and unanticipated, benefits: {ODD} improves the rigorous formulation of models and helps make the theoretical foundations of large models more visible. Although the protocol was designed for {ABMs}, it can help with documenting any large, complex model, alleviating some general objections against such models.},

We created an experimental-data driven agent-based model where the endogenous link between interaction outcome and social structure formation was examined starting from heterogeneous agent behaviour. By testing various social structure configurations, we showed that dynamic networks lead to more cooperation when agents can create more links and reduce exploitation opportunities by free riders. Furthermore, we found that the endogenous network formation was more important for cooperation than the type of network. Our results cast serious doubt about the static view of network structures on cooperation and can provide new insights into market efficiency.},

Various learning algorithms have been developed in recent years, including collapsed Gibbs sampling, variational inference, and maximum a posteriori estimation, and this variety motivates the need for careful empirical comparisons. In this paper, we highlight the close connections between these approaches. We find that the main differences are attributable to the amount of smoothing applied to the counts. When the hyperparameters are optimized, the differences in performance among the algorithms diminish significantly. The ability of these algorithms to achieve solutions of comparable accuracy gives us the freedom to select computationally efficient approaches. Using the insights gained from this comparative study, we show how accurate topic models can be learned in several seconds on text corpora with thousands of documents.},

Here, we describe a topic model for legislative speech, a statistical learning model that uses word choices to infer topical categories covered in a set of speeches and to identify the topic of specific speeches. Our method estimates, rather than assumes, the substance of topics, the keywords that identify topics, and the hierarchical nesting of topics. We use the topic model to examine the agenda in the U.S. Senate from 1997 to 2004. Using a new database of over 118,000 speeches (70,000,000 words) from the Congressional Record, our model reveals speech topic categories that are both distinctive and meaningfully interrelated and a richer view of democratic agenda dynamics than had previously been possible.},

How many hidden units are needed? Should weight decay be used, and if so how much? What type of output units should be chosen? And so on. We address these issues within the framework of statistical theory for model choice, which provides a number of workable approximate answers.  This paper is principally concerned with architecture selection issues for feed-forward neural networks (also known as multi-layer perceptrons). Many of the same issues arise in selecting radial basis function networks, recurrent networks and more widely. These problems occur in a much wider context within statistics, and applied statisticians have been selecting and combining models for decades. Two recent discussions are [4, 5].

We use an approximate Bayesian computational method in combination with a stochastic model of tuberculosis transmission and mutation of a molecular marker to estimate the net transmission rate, the doubling time, and the reproductive value of the pathogen. This method is applied to a published data set from San Francisco of tuberculosis genotypes based on the marker {IS}6110. The mutation rate of this marker has previously been studied, and we use those estimates to form a prior distribution of mutation rates in the inference procedure. The posterior point estimates of the key parameters of interest for these data are as follows: net transmission rate, 0.69/year [95\% credibility interval (C.I.) 0.38, 1.08]; doubling time, 1.08 years (95\% C.I. 0.64, 1.82); and reproductive value 3.4 (95\% C.I. 1.4, 79.7). These figures suggest a rapidly spreading epidemic, consistent with observations of the resurgence of tuberculosis in the United States in the 1980s and 1990s.},

It works by successively improving its evaluations of the quality of particular actions at particular states. This paper presents and proves in detail a convergence theorem {forQ}-learning based on that outlined in Watkins (1989). We show {thatQ}-learning converges to the optimum action-values with probability 1 so long as all actions are repeatedly sampled in all states and the action-values are represented discretely. We also sketch extensions to the cases of non-discounted, but absorbing, Markov environments, and where {manyQ} values can be changed each iteration, rather than just one.},

	title = {Using Symbolic Regression to Infer Strategies from Experimental Data},
	abstract = {. We propose the use of a new techinque--symbolic regression--as a method for inferring the strategies that are being played by subjects in economic decision making experiments. We begin by describing symbolic regression and our implementation of this technique using genetic programming. We provide a brief overview of how our algorithm works and how it can be used to uncover simple data generating functions that have the flavor of strategic rules. We then apply symbolic regression using genetic programming to experimental data from the repeated "ultimatum game." We discuss and analyze the strategies that we uncover using symbolic regression and conclude by arguing that symbolic regression techniques should at least complement standard regression analyses of experimental data.  1 Introduction  A frequently encountered problem in the analysis of data from economic decision--making experiments is how to infer subjects' strategies from their actions. The standard solution to this inference...},

A few examples of these candidate learners are: least squares, least angle regression, random forests, and spline regression. Previous articles (van der Laan and Dudoit (2003); van der Laan et al. (2006); Sinisi et al. (2007)) theoretically validated the use of cross validation to select an optimal learner among many candidate learners. Motivated by this use of cross validation, we propose a new prediction method for creating a weighted combination of many candidate learners to build the super learner. This article proposes a fast algorithm for constructing a super learner in prediction which uses V-fold cross-validation to select weights to combine an initial set of candidate learners. In addition, this paper contains a practical demonstration of the adaptivity of this so called super learner to various true data generating distributions. This approach for construction of a super learner generalizes to any parameter which can be defined as a minimizer of a loss function.},

The goal of this review is to quantify the capacity of increasingly complex modeling techniques to account for complex human and natural processes, uncertainty, and resilience across spatial and temporal scales. This review begins with coupled human and natural systems theory and situates urban water demand within this framework. The second section reviews urban water demand literature and summarizes methodological advances in relation to four central themes: (1) interactions within and across multiple spatial and temporal scales, (2) acknowledgment and quantification of uncertainty, (3) identification of thresholds, nonlinear system response, and the consequences for resilience, and (4) the transition from simple statistical modeling to fully integrated dynamic modeling. This review will show that increasingly effective models have resulted from technological advances in spatial science and innovations in statistical methods. These models provide unbiased, accurate estimates of the determinants of urban water demand at increasingly fine spatial and temporal resolution. Dynamic models capable of incorporating alternative future scenarios and local stochastic analysis are leading a trend away from deterministic prediction.},

	shorttitle = {Behavioral Game Theory},
	abstract = {Game theory, the formalized study of strategy, began in the 1940s by asking how emotionless geniuses should play games, but ignored until recently how average people with emotions and limited foresight actually play games. This book marks the first substantial and authoritative effort to close this gap. Colin Camerer, one of the field's leading figures, uses psychological principles and hundreds of experiments to develop mathematical theories of reciprocity, limited strategizing, and learning, which help predict what real people and companies do in strategic situations. Unifying a wealth of information from ongoing studies in strategic behavior, he takes the experimental science of behavioral economics a major step forward. He does so in lucid, friendly prose. Behavioral game theory has three ingredients that come clearly into focus in this book: mathematical theories of how moral obligation and vengeance affect the way people bargain and trust each other; a theory of how limits in the brain constrain the number of steps of "I think he thinks . . ." reasoning people naturally do; and a theory of how people learn from experience to make better strategic decisions. Strategic interactions that can be explained by behavioral game theory include bargaining, games of bluffing as in sports and poker, strikes, how conventions help coordinate a joint activity, price competition and patent races, and building up reputations for trustworthiness or ruthlessness in business or life. While there are many books on standard game theory that address the way ideally rational actors operate, Behavioral Game Theory stands alone in blending experimental evidence and psychology in a mathematical theory of normal strategic behavior. It is must reading for anyone who seeks a more complete understanding of strategic thinking, from professional economists to scholars and students of economics, management studies, psychology, political science, anthropology, and biology.},

	abstract = {Inferences about counterfactuals are essential for prediction,
answering what if questions, and estimating causal effects.
However, when the counterfactuals posed are too far from the data at
hand, conclusions drawn from well-specified statistical analyses
become based largely on speculation hidden in convenient modeling
assumptions that few would be willing to defend.  Unfortunately,
standard statistical approaches assume the veracity of the model
rather than revealing the degree of model-dependence, which makes this
problem hard to detect.  {WhatIf} offers easy-to-apply methods to
evaluate counterfactuals that do not require sensitivity testing over
specified classes of models.  If an analysis fails the tests offered
here, then we know that substantive inferences will be sensitive to at
least some modeling choices that are not based on empirical evidence,
no matter what method of inference one chooses to use.  {WhatIf}

This study aimed to identify the key determinants of household water use, with a view to identifying those factors that could be targeted in water demand management campaigns. Objective water use data and surveys were collected from 1008 households in four local government areas of southeast Queensland, Australia. Results showed that demographic, psychosocial, behavioral, and infrastructure variables all have a role to play in determining household water use. Consistent with past research, household occupancy was the most important predictor of water use. Households in regions recently exposed to drought conditions and higher-level restrictions also used less water than those who had less experience with drought. The effect of water efficient technology was mixed: some water efficient appliances were associated with less water use, while others were associated with more water use. Results also demonstrated the importance of considering water use as a collective behavior that is influenced by household dynamics. Households who reported a stronger culture of water conservation used less water. These findings, along with evidence that good water-saving habits are linked to water conservation, highlight the value of policies that support long-term cultural shifts in the way people think about and use water.},

Here, we performed two studies examining how these temporal effects generalize to games with richer social context cues. Study 1 found that time pressure increased cooperation to a similar extent in games played with in-group members and out-group members. Study 2 found that time pressure increased cooperation to a similar extent in games described as competitions and games described as collaborations. These results show that previous positive effects of time pressure on cooperation are not unique to neutrally framed games devoid of social context and are not driven by implicit assumptions of shared group membership or cooperative norms. In doing so, our findings provide further insight into the cognitive underpinnings of cooperative decision making. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {This paper shows that the accuracy of learned text classifiers can be improved by augmenting a small number of labeled training documents with a large pool of unlabeled documents. This is important because in many text classification problems obtaining training labels is expensive, while large quantities of unlabeled documents are readily available. We introduce an algorithm for learning from labeled and unlabeled documents based on the combination of Expectation-Maximization ({EM}) and a naive Bayes classifier. The algorithm first trains a classifier using the available labeled documents, and probabilistically labels the unlabeled documents. It then trains a new classifier using the labels for all the documents, and iterates to convergence. This basic {EM} procedure works well when the data conform to the generative assumptions of the model. However these assumptions are often violated in practice, and poor performance can result. We present two extensions to the algorithm that improve classification accuracy under these conditions: (1) a weighting factor to modulate the contribution of the unlabeled data, and (2) the use of multiple mixture components per class. Experimental results, obtained using text from three different real-world tasks, show that the use of unlabeled data reduces classification error by up to 30\%.},

In addition, our theory answers some open questions concerning the data on partners–strangers experiments. One interesting feature of the theory is that being a conditional cooperator is not a type but arises endogenously as a behavior. The data generated by our model are quantitatively similar to data from a variety of experiments, and experimenters, and are insensitive to moderate variations in the parameters of the model. That is, we have a robust explanation for most behavior in {VCM} experiments.},

A key innovation was the use of a postsampling regression adjustment, allowing larger tolerance values and as such shifting computation time to realistic orders of magnitude. Here we propose a reformulation of the regression adjustment in terms of a general linear model ({GLM}). This allows the integration into the sound theoretical framework of Bayesian statistics and the use of its methods, including model selection via Bayes factors. We then apply the proposed methodology to the question of population subdivision among western chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes verus.},

	abstract = {Game theory provides a quantitative framework for analyzing the behavior of rational agents. The Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma in particular has become a standard model for studying cooperation and cheating, with cooperation often emerging as a robust outcome in evolving populations. Here we extend evolutionary game theory by allowing players’ payoffs as well as their strategies to evolve in response to selection on heritable mutations. In nature, many organisms engage in mutually beneficial interactions and individuals may seek to change the ratio of risk to reward for cooperation by altering the resources they commit to cooperative interactions. To study this, we construct a general framework for the coevolution of strategies and payoffs in arbitrary iterated games. We show that, when there is a tradeoff between the benefits and costs of cooperation, coevolution often leads to a dramatic loss of cooperation in the Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma. The collapse of cooperation is so extreme that the average payoff in a population can decline even as the potential reward for mutual cooperation increases. Depending upon the form of tradeoffs, evolution may even move away from the Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma game altogether. Our work offers a new perspective on the Prisoner’s Dilemma and its predictions for cooperation in natural populations; and it provides a general framework to understand the coevolution of strategies and payoffs in iterated interactions.},

	abstract = {Summary Agent based modeling is a technique for simulating complex systems that allows the modeler to investigate both the potential for and the sources of emergent properties: behaviors of the system quite different from the behavior of any of the elements within it. Problems well suited to investigation by agent based models are those with many people solving a similar problem where their individual responses to the problem influence the choices that others make, where new technologies may emerge to assist them solve the problem, and where social dilemmas exist. These features are inherent in many problems of adaptation to climate change. Agent based modeling can not predict the future of a complex adaptive system – no method of modeling can – but it can offer insights into the relationship between features of current systems and the range of possible future adaptations that will be likely in response to climate change. Zusammenfassung Die agentenbasierte Modellierung als Methode der Simulation komplexer Systeme ermöglicht die Analyse von Potentialen und Ursprüngen emergenter Eigenschaften, die nicht allein auf Basis des Verhaltens der Elemente des Systems erklärt werden können. Für agentenbasierte Modellansätze bieten sich insbesondere solche Probleme an, bei denen eine Vielzahl von sich wechselseitig beeinflussenden Individuen in die Lösung desselben Problems einbezogen sind. Zudem kann die Entstehung neuartiger Techniken sowie bestehende Umgangsformen mit sozialen Dilemmasituationen analysiert werden. Die Probleme der Anpassung an den Klimawandel zeichnen sich durch diese Kennzeichen aus. Zwar kann die agentenbasierte Modellierung die Zukunft eines komplexen adaptiven Systems ebenso wenig vorhersagen wie andere Modelle, doch kann sie Einsichten in die Beziehungen zwischen verschiedenen Eigenschaften dieser Systeme und in die möglichen zukünftigen Anpassungsmaßnahmen an den Klimawandel und deren Kosten liefern.},

	abstract = {Advances in game theory have provided an impetus for renewed investigation of the strategic behaviour of oligopolists as players in repeated games. Marketing databases provide a rich source of historical evidence of such behaviour. This paper uses such data to examine how players in iterated oligopolies respond to their rivals’ behaviour, and uses machine learning to derive improved contingent strategies for such markets, in order to provide insights into the evolution of such markets and the patterns of behaviour observed. The paper is an application of repeated games and machine learning to adaptive behaviour over time in the retail market for ground coffee. Using empirical data on the weekly prices and promotional instruments of the four largest and several smaller coffee sellers in a regional U.S. retail market, and using a market model to predict sellers’ market shares and profits in response to others’ actions in any week, we examine the adaptive strategic behaviour of the three largest sellers. We model the sellers’ strategic behaviours as finite automata with memory of previous weeks’ actions, and use the Axelrod/Forrest representation of the action function, mapping state to action. We use a genetic algorithm ({GA}) to derive automata which are fit, given their environment, as described by their rivals’ actions in the past and the implicit demand for coffee.},

	abstract = {Screening in simulation experiments to find the most important factors, from a very large number of factors, is discussed. The method of sequential bifurcation in the presence of random noise is described and is demonstrated through a case study from the mobile telecommunications industry. The case study involves 92 factors and three related, discrete-event simulation models. These models represent three supply chain configurations of varying complexity that were studied for an Ericsson factory in Sweden. Five replicates of observations from 21 combinations of factor levels (or scenarios) are simulated under a particular noise distribution, and a shortlist of the 11 most important factors is identified for the most complex of the three models. Various different assumptions underlying the sequential bifurcation technique are discussed, including the role of first- and second-order polynomial regression models to describe the response, and knowledge of the directions and relative sizes of the factor main effects.},

However, there has been limited synthesis between shared problem traits, common {EA} challenges, and needed advances across major applications. This paper clarifies the current status and future research directions for better solving key water resources problems using {EAs}. Advances in understanding fitness landscape properties and their effects on algorithm performance are critical. Future {EA}-based applications to real-world problems require a fundamental shift of focus towards improving problem formulations, understanding general theoretic frameworks for problem decompositions, major advances in {EA} computational efficiency, and most importantly aiding real decision-making in complex, uncertain application contexts.},

Conversely aggregate models take less time for simulation and provide analytical understanding of the global evolution. Therefore they can sometimes profitably replace individual-based models. However, in many cases these models are linked to a model of environment which evolves over time.

In this paper we show that the relevance of using an aggregate vs. an individual based model of water consumption highly depends on the information available on the resource. We use two versions of a consumption model (individual-based and aggregate), simulating a reversible diffusion process which depends on the information available on the resource. We compare the results of the two models for various kinds links between the resource and consumption models and corresponding to the information about the resource provided to the consumers. We propose and test different properties of this information which might lead to difference of the results.},

A recently developed modelling approach is presented that can be used to predict the variation in likely catchment response to changes in woody cover using only broadly available data. The Biophysical Capacity to Change ({BC}2C) model combines a downward approach for water balance, with groundwater response using groundwater flow systems ({GFS}) mapping to provide hydrogeological and salinity parameters, into a spatial model for estimating the impacts of changes in woody vegetation cover across large areas. The results from the model are compared to gauged flow and salinity data for 14 stream gauging stations across the Murrumbidgee catchment, in south-eastern Australia. Considering the limited calibration of the model, the results compare favourably in broad terms, and provide a useful starting point for consideration of the impacts of land-use change on stream flow and salt load, and to guide catchment managers towards areas where more detailed study can be undertaken.},

	abstract = {When labelled training data is plentiful, discriminative techniques are widely used since they give excellent generalization performance. However, for large-scale applications such as object recognition, hand labelling of data is expensive, and there is much interest in semi-supervised techniques based on generative models in which the majority of the training data is unlabelled. Although the generalization performance of generative models can often be improved by 'training them discriminatively', they can then no longer make use of unlabelled data. In an attempt to gain the benefit of both generative and discriminative approaches, heuristic procedure have been proposed [2, 3] which interpolate between these two extremes by taking a convex combination of the generative and discriminative objective functions. In this paper we adopt a new perspective which says that there is only one correct way to train a given model, and that a 'discriminatively trained' generative model is fundamentally a new model [7]. From this viewpoint, generative and discriminative models correspond to specific choices for the prior over parameters. As well as giving a principled interpretation of 'discriminative training', this approach opens door to very general ways of interpolating between generative and discriminative extremes through alternative choices of prior. We illustrate this framework using both synthetic data and a practical example in the domain of multi-class object recognition. Our results show that, when the supply of labelled training data is limited, the optimum performance corresponds to a balance between the purely generative and the purely discriminative.},

	abstract = {Integrating computer simulation with conventional wet-lab research has proven to have much potential in furthering the understanding of biological systems. Success requires the relationship between simulation and the real-world system to be established: substantial aspects of the biological system are typically unknown, and the abstract nature of simulation can complicate interpretation of in silico results in terms of the biology. Here we present spartan (Simulation Parameter Analysis R Toolkit {ApplicatioN}), a package of statistical techniques specifically designed to help researchers understand this relationship and provide novel biological insight. The tools comprising spartan help identify which simulation results can be attributed to the dynamics of the modelled biological system, rather than artefacts of biological uncertainty or parametrisation, or simulation stochasticity. Statistical analyses reveal the influence that pathways and components have on simulation behaviour, offering valuable biological insight into aspects of the system under study. We demonstrate the power of spartan in providing critical insight into aspects of lymphoid tissue development in the small intestine through simulation. Spartan is released under a {GPLv}2 license, implemented within the open source R statistical environment, and freely available from both the Comprehensive R Archive Network ({CRAN}) and http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/spartan. The techniques within the package can be applied to traditional ordinary or partial differential equation simulations as well as agent-based implementations. Manuals, comprehensive tutorials, and example simulation data upon which spartan can be applied are available from the website.},

	abstract = {Cooperation in repeated games has been widely studied in experimental settings; however, the duration over which players participate in such experiments is typically confined to at most hours, and often to a single game. Given that in real world settings people may have years of experience, it is natural to ask how behavior in cooperative games evolves over the long run. Here we analyze behavioral data from three distinct games involving 571 individual experiments conducted over a two-year interval. First, in the case of a standard linear public goods game we show that as players gain experience, they become less generous both on average and in particular towards the end of each game. Second, we analyze a multiplayer prisoner's dilemma where players are also allowed to make and break ties with their neighbors, finding that experienced players show an increase in cooperativeness early on in the game, but exhibit sharper "endgame" effects. Third, and finally, we analyze a collaborative search game in which players can choose to act selfishly or cooperatively, finding again that experienced players exhibit more cooperative behavior as well as sharper endgame effects. Together these results show consistent evidence of long-run learning, but also highlight directions for future theoretical work that may account for the observed direction and magnitude of the effects.},

These "preference reversals" violate the principle of procedure invariance that is fundamental to theories of rational choice and raise difficult questions about the nature of human values. If different elicitation procedures produce different orderings of options, how can preferences be defined and in what sense do they exist? Describing and explaining such failures of invariance will require choice models of far greater complexity than the traditional models.},

It is important to evaluate how a model responds to changes in its inputs as part of the process of model development, verification, and evaluation. There are several techniques for sensitivity analysis used by practitioners and analysts in numerous fields. For example, sensitivity analysis methods are commonly builtin features of a particular software tool, e.g., Crystal Ball or @Risk. However, there are other sensitivity analysis methods, including those used outside of the natural resources field, applicable to integrated system models.

	title = {Prisoners Dilemma},
	url = {http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2014/entries/prisoner-dilemma/},
	abstract = {Tanya and Cinque have been arrested for robbing the Hibernia {SavingsBank} and placed in separate isolation cells. Both care much more abouttheir personal freedom than about the welfare of their accomplice. Aclever prosecutor makes the following offer to each. “You maychoose to confess or remain silent. If you confess and your accompliceremains silent I will drop all charges against you and use yourtestimony to ensure that your accomplice does serious time. Likewise,if your accomplice confesses while you remain silent, they will gofree while you do the time. If you both confess I get two convictions,but I'll see to it that you both get early parole. If you both remainsilent, I'll have to settle for token sentences on firearms possessioncharges. If you wish to confess, you must leave a note with the jailerbefore my return tomorrow morning.”, The “dilemma” faced by the prisoners here is that,whatever the other does, each is better off confessing than remainingsilent. But the outcome obtained when both confess is worse for eachthan the outcome they would have obtained had both remained silent. Acommon view is that the puzzle illustrates a conflict betweenindividual and group rationality. A group whose members pursuerational self-interest may all end up worse off than a group whosemembers act contrary to rational self-interest. More generally, if thepayoffs are not assumed to represent self-interest, a group whosemembers rationally pursue any goals may all meet less success than ifthey had not rationally pursued their goals individually. A closelyrelated view is that the prisoner's dilemma game and its multi-playergeneralizations model familiar situations in which it is difficult toget rational, selfish agents to cooperate for their common good. Muchof the contemporary literature has focused on identifying conditionsunder which players would or should make the “cooperative”move corresponding to remaining silent. A slightly differentinterpretation takes the game to represent a choice between selfishbehavior and socially desirable altruism. The move corresponding toconfession benefits the actor, no matter what the other does, whilethe move corresponding to silence benefits the other player no matterwhat that other player does. Benefiting oneself is not always wrong,of course, and benefiting others at the expense of oneself is notalways morally required, but in the prisoner's dilemma game bothplayers prefer the outcome with the altruistic moves to that with theselfish moves. This observation has led David Gauthier and others totake the Prisoner's Dilemma to say something important about thenature of morality., Here is another story. Bill has a blue cap and would prefer a red one,while Rose has a red cap and would prefer a blue one. Both prefer twocaps to any one and either of the caps to no cap at all. They are eachgiven a choice between keeping the cap they have or giving it to theother. This “exchange game” has the same structure as thestory about the prisoners. Whether Rose keeps her cap or gives {toBill}, Bill is better off keeping his and she is better off if he givesit to her. Whether Bill keeps his cap or gives it to Rose, Rose isbetter off keeping hers and he is better off if she gives it tohim. But both are better off if they exchange caps than if they bothkeep what they have. The new story suggests that the Prisoner'{sDilemma} also occupies a place at the heart of our economic system.  Itwould seem that any market designed to facilitate mutually beneficialexchanges will need to overcome the dilemma or avoid it., Puzzles with the structure of the prisoner's dilemma were devisedand discussed by Merrill Flood and Melvin Dresher in 1950, as part ofthe Rand Corporation's investigations into game theory (which Randpursued because of possible applications to global nuclearstrategy). The title “prisoner's dilemma” and the versionwith prison sentences as payoffs are due to Albert Tucker, who wantedto make Flood and Dresher's ideas more accessible to an audience {ofStanford} psychologists. Although Flood and Dresher didn't themselvesrush to publicize their ideas in external journal articles, the puzzlehas since attracted widespread and increasing attention in a varietyof disciplines. Donninger reports that “more than a thousandarticles” about it were published in the sixties andseventies. A bibliography (Axelrod and D'Ambrosio) of writings between1988 and 1994 that pertain to Robert Axelrod's research on the subjectlists 209 entries. A Google Scholar search for “prisoner'sdilemma” in 2014 returns 106,000 results., The sections below provide a variety of more precise characterizationsof the prisoner's dilemma, beginning with the narrowest, and surveysome connections with similar games and some applications inphilosophy and elsewhere. Particular attention is paid to“evolutionary” versions of the game in which members of apopulation play one another repeatedly and those who get higherpayoffs “reproduce” more rapidly than those who get lowerpayoffs. ‘Prisoner's dilemma’ is abbreviated as‘{PD}’.},

	abstract = {Marine allopatric speciation is an enigma because pelagic larval dispersal can potentially connect disjunct populations thereby preventing reproductive and morphological divergence. Here we present a new hierarchical approximate Bayesian computation model ({HABC}) that tests two hypotheses of marine allopatric speciation: 1.) "soft vicariance", where a speciation involves fragmentation of a large widespread ancestral species range that was previously connected by long distance gene flow; and 2.) peripatric colonization, where speciations in peripheral archipelagos emerge from sweepstakes colonizations from central source regions. The {HABC} approach analyzes all the phylogeographic datasets at once in order to make across taxon-pair inferences about biogeographic processes while explicitly allowing for uncertainty in the demographic differences within each taxon-pair. Our method uses comparative phylogeographic data that consists of single locus {mtDNA} sequences from multiple co-distributed taxa containing pairs of central and peripheral populations. We use the method on two comparative phylogeographic data sets consisting of cowrie gastropod endemics co-distributed in the Hawaiian (11 taxon-pairs) and Marquesan archipelagos (7 taxon-pairs).

	abstract = {In the production of clean steels, the occurrence of imperfections—so-called "Inclusions" — is unavoidable. The strength of a clean steel block is largely dependent on the size of the largest imperfection that it contains, so inference on extreme inclusion size forms an important part of quality control. Sampling is generally done by measuring imperfections on planar slices, leading to an extreme value version of a standard stereological problem: how to make inference on large inclusions using only the sliced observations. Under the assumption that inclusions are spherical, this problem has been tackled previously using a combination of extreme value models, stereological calculations, a Bayesian hierarchical model, and standard Markov chain Monte Carlo ({MCMC}) techniques. Our objectives in this article are twofold: (1) to assess the robustness of such inferences with respect to the assumption of spherical inclusions, and (2) to develop an inference procedure that is valid for nonspherical inclusions. We investigate both of these aspects by extending the spherical family for inclusion shapes to a family of ellipsoids. We then address the issue of rebustness by assessing the performance of the spherical model when fitted to measurements obtained from a simulation of ellipsoidal inclusions. The issue of inference is more difficult, because likelihood calculation is not feasible for the ellipsoidal model. To handle this aspect, we propose a modification to a recently developed likelihood-free {MCMC} algorithm. After verifying the viability and accuracy of the proposed algorithm through a simulation study, we analyze a real inclusion dataset, comparing the inference obtained under the ellipsoidal inclusion model with that previously obtained assuming spherical inclusions.},

We first trained our models to predict communal, extrajudicial, and criminal violence in 2010 using risk factors measured in 2008. We then made forecasts of actual violence in 2012, before collecting the 2012 data. Our model predicts up to 88\% of all violence in 2012. True positives come at the cost of many false positives, giving overall accuracy between 33\% and 50\%. From a policy perspective, states, international organizations, and peacekeepers could use such predictions to better prevent and respond to violence. The models also generate new stylized facts for theory to explain. In this instance, ethnic cleavages and minority group power-sharing are both associated with higher risk of violence.},

We present a simulation model as a computational test-bed for climate prediction markets. Traders adapt their beliefs about future temperatures based on the profits of other traders in their social network. We simulate two alternative climate futures, in which global temperatures are primarily driven either by carbon dioxide or by solar irradiance. These represent, respectively, the scientific consensus and a hypothesis advanced by prominent skeptics. We conduct sensitivity analyses to determine how a variety of factors describing both the market and the physical climate may affect traders' beliefs about the cause of global climate change. Market participation causes most traders to converge quickly toward believing the "true" climate model, suggesting that a climate market could be useful for building public consensus.},

However, they also suffer from the limitations of sensitivity to initialization and unigram topic distribution, which can be remedied by deep learning techniques. To explore the combination of topic modeling and deep learning techniques, we first explain the standard topic modelfrom the perspective of a neural network. Based on this, we propose a novel neural topic model ({NTM}) where the representation of words and documents are efficiently and naturally combined into a uniform framework. Extending from {NTM}, we can easily add a label layer and propose the supervised neural topic model ({sNTM}) to tackle supervised tasks. Experiments show that our models are competitive in both topic discovery and classification/regression tasks.},

In the third section, I discuss two major empirical findings that begin to show how individuals achieve results that are "better than rational" by building conditions where reciprocity, reputation, and trust can help to overcome the strong temptations of short-run self-interest. The fourth section raises the possibility of developing second-generation models of rationality, the fifth section develops an initial theoretical scenario, and the final section concludes by examining the implications of placing reciprocity, reputation, and trust at the core of an empirically tested, behavioral theory of collective action.},

However, current modeling practice is unsatisfactory. A literature review shows that the elements of good modeling practice have long been identified but are widely ignored. The reasons for this might include lack of involvement of decision makers, lack of incentives for modelers to follow good practice, and the use of inconsistent terminologies. As a strategy for the future, we propose a standard format for documenting models and their analyses: transparent and comprehensive ecological modeling ({TRACE}) documentation. This standard format will disclose all parts of the modeling process to scrutiny and make modeling itself more efficient and coherent.},

The experimental design represents an improvement over the existing literature by including sessions with finite repeated games as controls and a large number of players per session (which allows for learning without contagion effects). I find that the shadow of the future matters not only by significantly reducing opportunistic behavior, but also because its impact closely follows theoretical predictions.},

Yet hand coding many blogs, speeches, government records, newspapers, or other sources of unstructured text is infeasible. Although computer scientists have methods for automated content analysis, most are optimized to classify individual documents, whereas social scientists instead want generalizations about the population of documents, such as the proportion in a given category. Unfortunately, even a method with a high percent of individual documents correctly classified can be hugely biased when estimating category proportions. By directly optimizing for this social science goal, we develop a method that gives approximately unbiased estimates of category proportions even when the optimal classifier performs poorly. We illustrate with diverse data sets, including the daily expressed opinions of thousands of people about the U.S. presidency. We also make available software that implements our methods and large corpora of text for further analysis.},

	abstract = {The era of Big Data has begun. Computer scientists, physicists, economists, mathematicians, political scientists, bio-informaticists, sociologists, and many others are clamoring for access to the massive quantities of information produced by and about people, things, and their interactions. Diverse groups argue about the potential benefits and costs of analyzing information from Twitter, Google, Verizon, 23andMe, Facebook, Wikipedia, and every space where large groups of people leave digital traces and deposit data. Significant questions emerge. Will large-scale analysis of {DNA} help cure diseases? Or will it usher in a new wave of medical inequality? Will data analytics help make people’s access to information more efficient and effective? Or will it be used to track protesters in the streets of major cities? Will it transform how we study human communication and culture, or narrow the palette of research options and alter what ‘research’ means? Some or all of the above?This essay offers six provocations that we hope can spark conversations about the issues of Big Data. Given the rise of Big Data as both a phenomenon and a methodological persuasion, we believe that it is time to start critically interrogating this phenomenon, its assumptions, and its biases.(This paper was presented at Oxford Internet Institute’s “A Decade in Internet Time: Symposium on the Dynamics of the Internet and Society” on September 21, 2011.)},

	abstract = {This article shows the results of early crop yield prediction from remote-sensing data. The study was carried out in Kansas, {USA}. The methodology proposed allows the estimation of winter wheat ({WW}), sorghum and corn yields 3–4 months before harvest. The procedure uses the vegetation health ({VH}) indices (vegetation condition index ({VCI}) and temperature condition index ({TCI})) computed for each pixel and week over a 21-year period (1985–2005) from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer ({AVHRR}) data. Over this period, a strong correlation was found between crop yield and {VH} indices during the weather-related critical period of crop development, which controls much final crop productivity. The 3-month advanced yield forecasts were independently compared with official agricultural statistics, showing that the estimation errors for {WW}, sorghum and corn were 8\%, 6\% and 3\%, respectively. Implementing the 3–4 months lead forecast in operational practice will aid farmers to mitigate weather vagaries using irrigation, diseases/insects control, application of fertilizers and so on during a growing season and will help decision-makers to regulate marketing strategies, import/export and price policies and address food security issues.},

This method can be applied to optimize problems with any type of variables (variables from a real set, e.g., conveyor speed; an integer set, e.g., size of buffer; or any general set, e.g., dispatching rules). It is based on the association of an evolutionary algorithm and a simulation model. Extensions of Michalewicz's evolutionary operators and algorithm are proposed to tackle manufacturing system problems. The particular case of stochastic models is discussed. This method is applied to an example: the configuration of a workshop producing plastic yoghurt pots. The criterion to optimize is the cost of the workshop and the three variables are the size of a silo, the size of a warehouse and a choice between two manufacturing methods. The application has been realized by connecting an evolutionary algorithm programmed in C and a simulation language.},

	abstract = {This chapter explores the state of the emerging practice of designing markets by the use of agent-based modeling, with special reference to electricity markets and computerized (on-line) markets, perhaps including real-life electronic agents as well as human traders. The paper first reviews the use of evolutionary and agent-based techniques of analyzing market behaviors and market mechanisms, and economic models of learning, comparing genetic algorithms with reinforcement learning. Ideal design would be direct optimization of an objective function, but in practice the complexity of markets and traders' behavior prevents this, except in special circumstances. Instead, iterative analysis, subject to design criteria trade-offs, using autonomous self-interested agents, mimics the bottom-up evolution of historical market mechanisms by trial and error. The chapter highlights ten papers that exemplify recent progress in agent-based evolutionary analysis and design of markets in silico, using electricity markets and on-line double auctions as illustrations. A monopoly sealed-bid auction is examined in the tenth paper, and a new auction mechanism is evolved and analyzed. The chapter concludes that, as modeling the learning and behavior of traders improves, and as the software and hardware available for modeling and analysis improves, the techniques will provide ever greater insights into improving the designs of existing markets, and facilitating the design of new markets.},

We find that the rational expectations equilibrium price which can be discovered by genetic algorithms can also be discovered by genetic programming. Furthermore, genetic programming requires much less prior knowledge than genetic algorithms. The reasonable upper limit of the price and the characteristic of the equilibrium which is assumed as the prior knowledge in genetic algorithms can all be discovered by genetic programming. In addition, {GP}-based markets have a self-stabilizing force which is capable of bringing any deviations caused by mutation back to the rational expectations equilibrium price. All of these features show that genetic programming can be a very useful tool for economists to model learning and adaptation in multiagent systems. In particular, with respect to the understanding of the dynamics of the market process, it provides us with a visible foundation for the “invisible hand”. 1},

	abstract = {Social-ecological systems are complex adaptive systems where social and biophysical agents are interacting at multiple temporal and spatial scales. The main challenge for the study of governance of social-ecological systems is improving our understanding of the conditions under which cooperative solutions are sustained, how social actors can make robust decisions in the face of uncertainty and how the topology of interactions between social and biophysical actors affect governance. We review the contributions of agent-based modeling to these challenges for theoretical studies, studies which combines models with laboratory experiments and applications of practical case studies. Empirical studies from laboratory experiments and field work have challenged the predictions of the conventional model of the selfish rational agent for common pool resources and public-good games. Agent-based models have been used to test alternative models of decision-making which are more in line with the empirical record. Those models include bounded rationality, other regarding preferences and heterogeneity among the attributes of agents. Uncertainty and incomplete knowledge are directly related to the study of governance of social-ecological systems. Agent-based models have been developed to explore the consequences of incomplete knowledge and to identify adaptive responses that limited the undesirable consequences of uncertainties. Finally, the studies on the topology of agent interactions mainly focus on land use change, in which models of decision-making are combined with geographical information systems. Conventional approaches in environmental economics do not explicitly include non-convex dynamics of ecosystems, non-random interactions of agents, incomplete understanding, and empirically based models of behavior in collective action. Although agent-based modeling for social-ecological systems is in its infancy, it addresses the above features explicitly and is therefore potentially useful to address the current challenges in the study of governance of social-ecological systems.},

	abstract = {Seasonal climates dictate the livelihoods of farmers in developing 
countries. While farmers in developed countries often have seasonal
forecasts on which to base their cropping decisions, developing world
farmers usually make plans for the season without such information.
Climate change increases the seasonal uncertainty, making things more
difficult for farmers. Providing seasonal forecasts to these farmers is
seen as a way to help buffer these typically marginal groups from the
effects of climate change, though how to do so and the efficacy of such
an effort is still uncertain. In Sri Lanka, an effort is underway to
provide such forecasts to farmers. The accuracy of these forecasts is
likely to have large impacts on how farmers accept and respond to the
information they receive. We present an agent-based model to explore how
the accuracy of seasonal rainfall forecasts affects the growing
decisions and behavior of farmers in Sri Lanka. Using a decision
function based on prospect theory, this model simulates farmers'
behavior in the face of a wet, dry, or normal forecast. Farmers can
either choose to grow paddy rice or plant a cash crop. Prospect theory
is used to evaluate outcomes of the growing season; the farmer's memory
of the level of success under a certain set of conditions affects next
season's decision. Results from this study have implications for policy
makers and seasonal forecasters.},

They study both the ex post ('best fit') descriptive power of learning models, and their ex ante predictive power, by simulating each experiment using parameters estimated from the other experiments. Even a one-parameter reinforcement learning model robustly outperforms the equilibrium predictions. Predictive power is improved by adding 'forgetting' and 'experimentation,' or by allowing greater rationality as in probabilistic fictitious play.

David Batten interweaves anecdotes and stories with technical discussions in order to provide the general reader with a good feel for how economies function and change. Using a wealth of examples from evolutionary game theory, to stock markets, to urban and traffic planning, Batten shows how economic agents interact to produce the behavior we have come to recognize as economic life. Despite the book's easy-to-read style, Batten's message is quite profound. Strongly interactive groups of agents can produce unexpected collective behavior, emergent features that are lawful in their own right. These patterns of emergent behavior are the hallmark of a complex, self-organizing economy."--{BOOK} {JACKET}.},

The model hyperparameters are inferred using a Gibbs {EM} algorithm. On two data sets, each of 150 documents, the new model exhibits better predictive accuracy than either a hierarchical Dirichlet bigram language model or a unigram topic model. Additionally, the inferred topics are less dominated by function words than are topics discovered using unigram statistics, potentially making them more meaningful.},

It remains unclear to what extent these strategies are generalizable or vary across regions. In this study we ask about three potential key factors influencing farming households’ ability to adapt: access to weather information, household and agricultural production-related assets, and participation in local social institutions. We use a 12-country data set from sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia to explore the links between these three potential drivers of agricultural change and the likelihood that farmers made farm-associated changes, such as adopting improved crop varieties, increasing fertilizer use, investing in improved land management practices, and changing the timing of agricultural activities. We find evidence that access to weather information, assets, and participation in social institutions are associated with households that have reported making farming changes in recent years, although these results vary across countries and types of practices. Understanding these drivers and outcomes of farm-associated changes across different socio-economic and environmental conditions is critical for ongoing dialogues for climate-resilient strategies and policies for increasing the adaptive capacity of smallholders under climate change.},

Further progress towards understanding compositionality in tasks such as sentiment detection requires richer supervised training and evaluation resources and more powerful models of composition. To remedy this, we introduce a Sentiment Treebank. It includes fine grained sentiment labels for 215,154 phrases in the parse trees of 11,855 sentences and presents new challenges for sentiment compositionality. To address them, we introduce the Recursive Neural Tensor Network. When trained on the new treebank, this model outperforms all previous methods on several metrics. It pushes the state of the art in single sentence positive/negative classification from 80 \% up to 85.4\%. The accuracy of predicting fine-grained sentiment labels for all phrases reaches 80.7\%, an improvement of 9.7 \% over bag of features baselines. Lastly, it is the only model that can accurately capture the effects of negation and its scope at various tree levels for both positive and negative phrases. 1},

	abstract = {The considerable complexity often included in biophysical models leads to the need of specifying a large number of parameters and inputs, which are available with various levels of uncertainty. Also, models may behave counter-intuitively, particularly when there are nonlinearities in multiple input–output relationships. Quantitative knowledge of the sensitivity of models to changes in their parameters is hence a prerequisite for operational use of models. This can be achieved using sensitivity analysis ({SA}) via methods which differ for specific characteristics, including computational resources required to perform the analysis. Running {SA} on biophysical models across several contexts requires flexible and computationally efficient {SA} approaches, which must be able to account also for possible interactions among parameters. A number of {SA} experiments were performed on a crop model for the simulation of rice growth (Water Accounting Rice Model, {WARM}) in Northern Italy. {SAs} were carried out using the Morris method, three regression-based methods (Latin hypercube sampling, random and Quasi-Random, {LpTau}), and two methods based on variance decomposition: Extended Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test (E-{FAST}) and Sobol’, with the latter adopted as benchmark. Aboveground biomass at physiological maturity was selected as reference output to facilitate the comparison of alternative {SA} methods. Rankings of crop parameters (from the most to the least relevant) were generated according to sensitivity experiments using different {SA} methods and alternate parameterizations for each method, and calculating the top-down coefficient of concordance ({TDCC}) as measure of agreement between rankings. With few exceptions, significant {TDCC} values were obtained both for different parameterizations within each method and for the comparison of each method to the Sobol’ one. The substantial stability observed in the rankings seem to indicate that, for a crop model of average complexity such as {WARM}, resource intensive {SA} methods could not be needed to identify most relevant parameters. In fact, the simplest among the {SA} methods used (i.e., Morris method) produced results comparable to those obtained by methods more computationally expensive.},

It addresses a criticism that an earlier model ({EWA}) has too many parameters, by fixing some parameters at plausible values and replacing others with functions of experience so that they no longer need to be estimated. Consequently, it is econometrically simpler than the popular weighted fictitious play and reinforcement learning models. The functions of experience which replace free parameters “self-tune” over time, adjusting in a way that selects a sensible learning rule to capture subjects’ choice dynamics. For instance, the self-tuning {EWA} model can turn from a weighted fictitious play into an averaging reinforcement learning as subjects equilibrate and learn to ignore inferior foregone payoffs. The theory was tested on seven different games, and compared to the earlier parametric {EWA} model and a one-parameter stochastic equilibrium theory ({QRE}). Self-tuning {EWA} does as well as {EWA} in predicting behavior in new games, even though it has fewer parameters, and fits reliably better than the {QRE} equilibrium benchmark.},

These topics lie at the heart of many exciting areas of contemporary science and engineering - communication, signal processing, data mining, machine learning, pattern recognition, computational neuroscience, bioinformatics, and cryptography.    This textbook introduces theory in tandem with applications. Information theory is taught alongside practical communication systems, such as arithmetic coding for data compression and sparse-graph codes for error-correction. A toolbox of inference techniques, including message-passing algorithms, Monte Carlo methods, and variational approximations, are developed alongside applications of these tools to clustering, convolutional codes, independent component analysis, and neural networks.    The final part of the book describes the state of the art in error-correcting codes, including low-density parity-check codes, turbo codes, and digital fountain codes -- the twenty-first century standards for satellite communications, disk drives, and data broadcast.     Richly illustrated, filled with worked examples and over 400 exercises, some with detailed solutions, David {MacKay}'s groundbreaking book is ideal for self-learning and for undergraduate or graduate courses. Interludes on crosswords, evolution, and sex provide entertainment along the way.    In sum, this is a textbook on information, communication, and coding for a new generation of students, and an unparalleled entry point into these subjects for professionals in areas as diverse as computational biology, financial engineering, and machine learning.},

A competing hypothesis argues that when behaviors require social reinforcement, a network with more clustering may be more advantageous, even if the network as a whole has a larger diameter. I investigated the effects of network structure on diffusion by studying the spread of health behavior through artificially structured online communities. Individual adoption was much more likely when participants received social reinforcement from multiple neighbors in the social network.

	abstract = {Topic models, such as latent Dirichlet allocation ({LDA}), can be useful tools for the statistical analysis of document collections and other discrete data. The {LDA} model assumes that the words of each document arise from a mixture of topics, each of which is a distribution over the vocabulary. A limitation of {LDA} is the inability to model topic correlation even though, for example, a document about genetics is more likely to also be about disease than X-ray astronomy. This limitation stems from the use of the Dirichlet distribution to model the variability among the topic proportions. In this paper we develop the correlated topic model ({CTM}), where the topic proportions exhibit correlation via the logistic normal distribution [J. Roy. Statist. Soc. Ser. B 44 (1982) 139-177]. We derive a fast variational inference algorithm for approximate posterior inference in this model, which is complicated by the fact that the logistic normal is not conjugate to the multinomial. We apply the {CTM} to the articles from Science published from 1990-1999, a data set that comprises 57M words. The {CTM} gives a better fit of the data than {LDA}, and we demonstrate its use as an exploratory tool of large document collections.},

	abstract = {Accuracy of results from mathematical and computer models of biological systems is often complicated by the presence of uncertainties in experimental data that are used to estimate parameter values. Current mathematical modeling approaches typically use either single-parameter or local sensitivity analyses. However, these methods do not accurately assess uncertainty and sensitivity in the system as, by default, they hold all other parameters fixed at baseline values. Using techniques described within we demonstrate how a multi-dimensional parameter space can be studied globally so all uncertainties can be identified. Further, uncertainty and sensitivity analysis techniques can help to identify and ultimately control uncertainties. In this work we develop methods for applying existing analytical tools to perform analyses on a variety of mathematical and computer models. We compare two specific types of global sensitivity analysis indexes that have proven to be among the most robust and efficient. Through familiar and new examples of mathematical and computer models, we provide a complete methodology for performing these analyses, in both deterministic and stochastic settings, and propose novel techniques to handle problems encountered during these types of analyses.},

Fundamental collective behaviors such as group formation, cultural transmission, combat, and trade are seen to "emerge" from the interaction of individual agents following a few simple rules.  In their program, named Sugarscape, Epstein and Axtell begin the development of a "bottom up" social science that is capturing the attention of researchers and commentators alike. The study is part of the 2050 Project, a joint venture of the Santa Fe Institute, the World Resources Institute, and the Brookings Institution. The project is an international effort to identify conditions for a sustainable global system in the next century and to design policies to help achieve such a system. "Growing Artificial Societies" is also available on {CD}-{ROM}, which includes about 50 animations that develop the scenarios described in the text.  "Copublished with the Brookings Institution"},

Volume under the surface and hypervolume under the manifold have been proposed as extensions for multiple class diagnosis (Scurfield, 1996, 1998). However, the lack of simple inferential procedures for such measures has limited their practical utility. Part of the difficulty is that calculating such quantities may not be straightforward, even with a single test. The decision rule used to generate the {ROC} surface requires class probability assessments, which are not provided by the tests. We develop a method based on estimating the probabilities via some procedure, for example, multinomial logistic regression. Bootstrap inferences are proposed to account for variability in estimating the probabilities and perform well in simulations. The {ROC} measures are compared to the correct classification rate, which depends heavily on class prevalences. An example of tumor classification with microarray data demonstrates that this property may lead to substantially different analyses. The {ROC}-based analysis yields notable decreases in model complexity over previous analyses.},

We examine the actual role played by prior distributions in Bayesian models, and the crucial aspects of model checking and model revision, which fall outside the scope of Bayesian confirmation theory. We draw on the literature on the consistency of Bayesian updating and also on our experience of applied work in social science. Clarity about these matters should benefit not just philosophy of science, but also statistical practice. At best, the inductivist view has encouraged researchers to fit and compare models without checking them; at worst, theorists have actively discouraged practitioners from performing model checking because it does not fit into their framework.},

Approximate Bayesian computation ({ABC}) is a method of inference for such models. It replaces calculation of the likelihood by a step which involves simulating artificial data for different parameter values, and comparing summary statistics of the simulated data with summary statistics of the observed data. Here we show how to construct appropriate summary statistics for {ABC} in a semi-automatic manner. We aim for summary statistics which will enable inference about certain parameters of interest to be as accurate as possible. Theoretical results show that optimal summary statistics are the posterior means of the parameters. Although these cannot be calculated analytically, we use an extra stage of simulation to estimate how the posterior means vary as a function of the data; and we then use these estimates of our summary statistics within {ABC}. Empirical results show that our approach is a robust method for choosing summary statistics that can result in substantially more accurate {ABC} analyses than the ad hoc choices of summary statistics that have been proposed in the literature. We also demonstrate advantages over two alternative methods of simulation-based inference.},

	abstract = {Water resource represents an important stake for human development. Studies show that under the currently growing demand this resource can become scarce, therefore, leading to the necessity of reducing unnecessary demand. Household needs often represent an important proportion of the overall demand, while individual costs are not high enough to lead the consumer to restrict his demand to the essential. Therefore, besides pricing policies, evaluating the impact of various incentives and information policies in reducing household demand represents a current stake in modelling for water management support. One of the major difficulties for this is to account for local information ignoring spatial inter-dependence of the resource and heterogeneity in the population.

In this paper, we tackle the possibility of simulating a composite population of water consumers and/or more than one water resource by a linear approximation derived from simple configurations (a single consumer population linked to a single resource). We model a reversible diffusion of careful consumption behaviours in a population influenced by public information on the resource. Our results show that the adequacy of linear approximation depends on the choice of information provided to the consumers, and more particularly on the definition of a state of crisis. We discuss implications of this result from various points of view.},

{METHODS}: Two data sets, taken from problems as diverse as screening for dementia and assessing the risk of mental retardation, were collected and a rule learning system, with and without monotonicity constraints, was run on each. The rules were shown to experts, who were asked how willing they would be to use such rules in practice. The accuracy of the rules was also evaluated.
{RESULTS}: Rules learned with monotonicity constraints were at least as accurate as rules learned without such constraints. Experts were, on average, more willing to use the rules learned with the monotonicity constraints.
{CONCLUSIONS}: The analysis of medical databases has the potential of improving patient outcomes and/or lowering the cost of health care delivery. Various techniques, from statistics, pattern recognition, machine learning, and neural networks, have been proposed to "mine" this data by uncovering patterns that may be used to guide decision making. This study suggests cognitive factors make learned models coherent and, therefore, credible to experts. One factor that influences the acceptance of learned models is consistency with existing medical knowledge.},

The method is an alternative to the traditional lossless compression algorithms, which it may complement, the two being serviceable for different string lengths. We provide a thorough analysis for all binary strings of length and for most strings of length by running all Turing machines with 5 states and 2 symbols ( with reduction techniques) using the most standard formalism of Turing machines, used in for example the Busy Beaver problem. We address the question of stability and error estimation, the sensitivity of the continued application of the method for wider coverage and better accuracy, and provide statistical evidence suggesting robustness. As with compression algorithms, this work promises to deliver a range of applications, and to provide insight into the question of complexity calculation of finite (and short) strings.Additional material can be found at the Algorithmic Nature Group website at http://www.algorithmicnature.org.

In this study, a probabilistic model to generate residential demand patterns for single-family and semidetached houses is formed. To form these pattern models, an automated meter reading technique has been utilized to gather the necessary information from a sample of residences, which are used to model the demand behavior in a way that is applicable to a much wider range of residences. A linear regression model was constructed to predict the measured average weekly consumption from the calculated average weekly consumption. The residences were clustered by their weekly water demand into four distinct classes using the k-means algorithm. For the final result, probability models developed on the basis of mixtures of Gaussians for each class, in conjunction with the prediction model of the weekly water consumption, were utilized so that estimates for the demand pattern are obtained by sampling the probability distributions for individual single-family and semidetached houses.},

Previous behavioral experiments of commons dilemmas have found that people are willing to engage in costly punishment, frequently generating increases in gross benefits, contrary to game-theoretical predictions based on a static pay-off function. Results in our experimental environment find that costly punishment is again used but lacks a gross positive effect on resource harvesting unless combined with communication.

Water demand management has an important role to play in reducing the vulnerability of freshwater supplies to climate change impacts. In this paper, we argue that the field of psychology and environmental psychology in particular can make a vital contribution in understanding further the drivers of residential water demand. A growing body of literature in environmental psychology has examined the determinants of water conservation behavior, and this research has many potential applications for water demand policy. In this paper we offer a review of current psychological research that examines the five broad causes of residential water conservation behaviors: attitudes, beliefs, habits or routines, personal capabilities, and contextual factors. We assess how psychologists have studied water conservation behavior to date, identify shortcomings, and indicate how this research can be used to further promote residential water conservation and to inform evidence-based policy and practice.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we describe an experiment in which the position of scientists with respect to flood risk management is fundamentally changed. Building on a review of three very different approaches to engaging the public in science, we contrast the normal way in which science is used in flood risk management in England and Wales with an experiment in which knowledge regarding flooding was co-produced. This illustrates a way of working with experts, both certified (academic natural and social scientists) and non-certified (local people affected by flooding), for whom flooding is a matter of concern, and where the event, flooding, is given agency in the experiment. We reveal a deep and distributed understanding of flood hydrology across all experts, certified and uncertified, involved in the experiment. This did not map onto the conventional dichotomy between ‘universal’ scientific expertise and ‘local’ lay expertise. By working with the event we harnessed, produced and negotiated a new and collective sense of knowledge, sufficient in our experiment to make a public intervention in flood risk management in our case-study location. The manner in which the academic scientists involved in the practice of their science were repositioned was radical as compared with normal scientific method. It was also radical for a more fundamental reason: the purpose of our experiment became as much about creating a new public capable of making a political intervention in a situation of impasse, as it was about producing the solution itself. The practice of knowledge generation, the science undertaken, worked with the hybridisation of science and politics rather than trying to extract science from it.},

Such systems--whether political parties, stock markets, or ant colonies--present some of the most intriguing theoretical and practical challenges confronting the social sciences. Engagingly written, and balancing technical detail with intuitive explanations, Complex Adaptive Systems focuses on the key tools and ideas that have emerged in the field since the mid-1990s, as well as the techniques needed to investigate such systems. It provides a detailed introduction to concepts such as emergence, self-organized criticality, automata, networks, diversity, adaptation, and feedback. It also demonstrates how complex adaptive systems can be explored using methods ranging from mathematics to computational models of adaptive agents.  John Miller and Scott Page show how to combine ideas from economics, political science, biology, physics, and computer science to illuminate topics in organization, adaptation, decentralization, and robustness. They also demonstrate how the usual extremes used in modeling can be fruitfully transcended.},

	abstract = {This paper uses genetic algorithms to model the solution to a coordination problem through learning. The coordination problem arises out of the following two stage game. At core of the two stage game is a model of social interaction in which players use visible goods as signals about the identity of other players. If these signals are informative enough, players use them to condition their social interaction. Importantly, accurate signals are mutually beneficial. This game is then wrapped in another in which players choose their visible goods. There are many types of players and many visible goods that could be used to signal type. There are many equilibria of the two stage game, some of which allow individuals to perfectly signal their type in all social interactions, and others of which do not. The perfect signaling equilibria Pareto dominate the others, but since there are many of them, the players face a difficult coordination problem. We approach this coordination problem using genetic algorithms to simulate learning in this game. A player is a genetic code that evolves via selection. Questions of primary interest concern the set of parameter values such that the players manage to solve the coordination problem. The results of simulations indicate that the convergence of the genetic algorithm to a perfect signaling equilibrium depends on the values of the parameters that determine players' payoffs. We analyze two different scenarios. In one scenario, each player makes one (unconditional) decision to either use the visible goods displayed by other players as type signals, or to ignore the visible goods they display. In the other scenario, the decision to regard a player's visible good as a type signal is conditional on the good displayed. Our results indicate that it is easier for players to solve the coordination problem under the second scenario.},

These comprised all articles that referred to government support for the arts in the U.S. published in five U.S. newspapers between 1986 and 1997—a period during which such assistance, once noncontroversial, became a focus of contention. We illustrate the strengths of topic modeling as a means of analyzing large text corpora, discuss the proper choice of models and interpretation of model results, describe means of validating topic-model solutions, and demonstrate the use of topic models in combination with other statistical tools to estimate differences between newspapers in the prevalence of different frames. Throughout, we emphasize affinities between the topic-modeling approach and such central concepts in the study of culture as framing, polysemy, heteroglossia, and the relationality of meaning.},

The most certain information available on new households during planning are the physical characteristics of the properties themselves. This paper sets out to establish how to classify properties in terms of their physical characteristics for the purpose of forecasting water demand. Analysis of household water demand under a univariate classification of property type showed significant differences for properties of different size (number of bedrooms), architectural type (e.g. flats vs. terraced) and garden presence but not for age or for garden aspect. Analysis of household water demand under a multivariate classification of property type showed fewer significant differences between property types. The results of the study were compared to studies and found to fit qualitatively. However, quantitative differences were noted indicating geographical and sampling variation which requires further investigation. In addition, further research is required to determine the relative certainty of forecasts derived from physical vs. socio-economic or demographic characteristics.},

	abstract = {Vector-based models of word meaning have become increasingly popular in cognitive science. The appeal of these models lies in their ability to represent meaning simply by using distributional information under the assumption that words occurring within similar contexts are semantically similar. Despite their widespread use, vector-based models are typically directed at representing words in isolation, and methods for constructing representations for phrases or sentences have received little attention in the literature. This is in marked contrast to experimental evidence (e.g., in sentential priming) suggesting that semantic similarity is more complex than simply a relation between isolated words. This article proposes a framework for representing the meaning of word combinations in vector space. Central to our approach is vector composition, which we operationalize in terms of additive and multiplicative functions. Under this framework, we introduce a wide range of composition models that we evaluate empirically on a phrase similarity task.},

	shorttitle = {Small Worlds},
	abstract = {Everyone knows the small-world phenomenon: soon after meeting a stranger, we are surprised to discover that we have a mutual friend, or we are connected through a short chain of acquaintances. In his book, Duncan Watts uses this intriguing phenomenon--colloquially called "six degrees of separation"--as a prelude to a more general exploration: under what conditions can a small world arise in any kind of network? The networks of this story are everywhere: the brain is a network of neurons; organisations are people networks; the global economy is a network of national economies, which are networks of markets, which are in turn networks of interacting producers and consumers. Food webs, ecosystems, and the Internet can all be represented as networks, as can strategies for solving a problem, topics in a conversation, and even words in a language. Many of these networks, the author claims, will turn out to be small worlds. How do such networks matter? Simply put, local actions can have global consequences, and the relationship between local and global dynamics depends critically on the network's structure. Watts illustrates the subtleties of this relationship using a variety of simple models---the spread of infectious disease through a structured population; the evolution of cooperation in game theory; the computational capacity of cellular automata; and the sychronisation of coupled phase-oscillators. Watts's novel approach is relevant to many problems that deal with network connectivity and complex systems' behaviour in general: How do diseases (or rumours) spread through social networks? How does cooperation evolve in large groups? How do cascading failures propagate through large power grids, or financial systems? What is the most efficient architecture for an organisation, or for a communications network? This fascinating exploration will be fruitful in a remarkable variety of fields, including physics and mathematics, as well as sociology, economics, and biology.},

	abstract = {Unlike other species, humans cooperate in large, distantly related groups, a fact that has long presented a puzzle to biologists. The pathway by which adaptations for large-scale cooperation among nonkin evolved in humans remains a subject of vigorous debate. Results from theoretical analyses and agent-based simulations suggest that evolutionary dynamics need not yield homogeneous populations, but can instead generate a polymorphic population that consists of individuals who vary in their degree of cooperativeness. These results resonate with the recent increasing emphasis on the importance of individual differences in understanding and modeling behavior and dynamics in experimental games and decision problems. Here, we report the results of laboratory experiments that complement both theory and simulation results. We find that our subjects fall into three types, an individual's type is stable, and a group's cooperative outcomes can be remarkably well predicted if one knows its type composition. Reciprocal types, who contribute to the public good as a positive function of their beliefs about others' contributions, constitute the majority (63\%) of players; cooperators and free-riders are also present in our subject population. Despite substantial behavioral differences, earnings among types are statistically identical. Our results support the view that our human subject population is in a stable, polymorphic equilibrium of types.},

	abstract = {This paper examines the use of evolutionary programming in agent‐based modelling to implement the theory of bounded rationality. Evolutionary programming, which draws on Darwinian analogues of computing to create software programs, is a readily accepted means for solving complex computational problems. Evolutionary programming is also increasingly used to develop problem‐solving strategies in accordance with bounded rationality, which addresses features of human decision‐making such as cognitive limits, learning, and innovation. There remain many unanswered methodological and conceptual questions about the linkages between bounded rationality and evolutionary programming. This paper reports on how changing parameters in one variant of evolutionary programming, genetic programming, affects the representation of bounded rationality in software agents. Of particular interest are: the ability of agents to solve problems; limits to the complexity of agent strategies; the computational resources with which agents create, maintain, or expand strategies; and the extent to which agents balance exploration of new strategies and exploitation of old strategies.},

This involves a "moderation" of the most probable classifier's outputs, and yields improved performance. Second, it is demonstrated that the Bayesian framework for model comparison described for regression models in {MacKay} (1992a,b) can also be applied to classification problems. This framework successfully chooses the magnitude of weight decay terms, and ranks solutions found using different numbers of hidden units. Third, an information-based data selection criterion is derived and demonstrated within this framework.},

	abstract = {A variety of market mechanisms have been proposed and implemented around the world in order to create competitive electricity pools and exchanges. However, it is an open question whether pool-based daily auctions or continuous bilateral trading deliver different prices under conditions of market power. In this paper we present a computationally intensive simulation model of the wholesale electricity market in England and Wales to isolate and systematically test the potential impact of alternative trading arrangements on electricity prices. After eight years of trading under a pool-based system, proposals were initiated in 1998 to change the market in England and Wales to bilateral trading. This paper uses an agent-based simulation to evaluate two important aspects of that proposal. The results show that daily bidding with Pay {SMP} settlement, as in the original Pool day-ahead market, produces the lowest prices while hourly bidding with Pay Bid settlement, as proposed for the bilateral model, produces the highest prices.},

We model documents as if they were generated by a two-stage stochastic process. An author is represented by a probability distribution over topics, and each topic is represented as a probability distribution over words. The probability distribution over topics in a multi-author paper is a mixture of the distributions associated with the authors. The topic-word and author-topic distributions are learned from data in an unsupervised manner using a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. We apply the methodology to three large text corpora: 150,000 abstracts from the {CiteSeer} digital library, 1740 papers from the Neural Information Processing Systems ({NIPS}) Conferences, and 121,000 emails from the Enron corporation. We discuss in detail the interpretation of the results discovered by the system including specific topic and author models, ranking of authors by topic and topics by author, parsing of abstracts by topics and authors, and detection of unusual papers by specific authors. Experiments based on perplexity scores for test documents and precision-recall for document retrieval are used to illustrate systematic differences between the proposed author-topic model and a number of alternatives. Extensions to the model, allowing for example, generalizations of the notion of an author, are also briefly discussed.},

	isbn = {978-1-84339-078-7},
	abstract = {A common characteristic of water demand in urban areas worldwide is its inexorable rise over many years, and projections of continuing growth over coming decades. The chief influencing factors are population growth and migration, together with changes in lifestyle, demographic structure and the possible effects of climate change. The detailed implications of climate change are not yet clear, and anyway will depend on global location, but must at least increase the uncertainty in security of supply. This is compounded by rapid development, creeping urbanization and, in some places, rising standards of living. Meeting this increasing demand from existing resources is self-evidently an uphill struggle, particularly in water stressed/scarce regions, in the developed and developing world alike. There are typically two potential responses; either 'supply-side' (meeting demand with new resources) or 'demand-side' (managing consumptive demand itself to postpone or avoid the need to develop new resources). There is considerable pressure from the general public, regulatory agencies, and some governments to minimise the impacts of new supply projects (e.g. building new reservoirs or inter-regional transfer schemes), implying the emphasis should be shifted towards managing water demand by best utilising the water that is already available. Water Demand Management has been produced by the academic/government/industry network {WATERSAVE}. The concept of the book was to assemble a comprehensive picture of demand management topics ranging from technical to social and legal aspects, through expert critical literature reviews on the subject. The depth and breadth of coverage is a unique contribution to the field and the book will be an invaluable information source for practitioners and researchers, including water utility engineers/planners, environmental regulators, equipment and service providers, and postgraduates.},

	abstract = {In this paper, sensitivity analysis ({SA}) has been used to assess model sensitivities to input parameter values in a water quality model. The water quality model incorporates a rainfall-runoff sub-model and a sediment load estimation sub-model, and is calibrated against hydrologic and water quality data from the Moruya River catchment in southeast Australia. The tested methods, One-at-A-Time ({OAT}), Morris Method ({MM}) and Regional {SA} ({RSA}) are found to be complementary, and help to characterise the behaviour of the water quality model. The most important parameters are plant stress threshold (f), coefficient of evapotranspiration (e), catchment moisture threshold (d), in decreasing order, indicating that sediment and nutrient loads are more sensitive to parameters that affect the magnitude of flows than those (v"s, @t{\textasciicircum}q, @t{\textasciicircum}s) that control the timing and shape of the peak in a time series. But this application shows a need to be flexible in the use of different {SA} techniques. {RSA} is more appropriate for complex models where system nonlinearities and parameter interactions are more likely to be important. The {RSA} suggests that f and v"s have strong interactions in the influence on nitrogen estimation. This study is also valuable for future uncertainty analysis, by separating the source of uncertainty of model parameters from the uncertainty in the model inputs.},

	abstract = {The statistical and econometrics literature on causality is more focused on "effects of causes" than on "causes of effects." That is, in the standard approach it is natural to study the effect of a treatment, but it is not in general possible to define the causes of any particular outcome. This has led some researchers to dismiss the search for causes as "cocktail party chatter" that is outside the realm of science. We argue here that the search for causes can be understood within traditional statistical frameworks as a part of model checking and hypothesis generation. We argue that it can make sense to ask questions about the causes of effects, but the answers to these questions will be in terms of effects of causes.},

	abstract = {Agent-based modeling is a new technique for understanding how the dynamics of biological, social, and other complex systems arise from the characteristics and behaviors of the agents making up these systems. This innovative textbook gives students and scientists the skills to design, implement, and analyze agent-based models. It starts with the fundamentals of modeling and provides an introduction to {NetLogo}, an easy-to-use, free, and powerful software platform. Nine chapters then each introduce an important modeling concept and show how to implement it using {NetLogo}. The book goes on to present strategies for finding the right level of model complexity and developing theory for agent behavior, and for analyzing and learning from models.Agent-Based and Individual-Based Modeling features concise and accessible text, numerous examples, and exercises using small but scientific models. The emphasis throughout is on analysis--such as software testing, theory development, robustness analysis, and understanding full models--and on design issues like optimizing model structure and finding good parameter values.The first hands-on introduction to agent-based modeling, from conceptual design to computer implementation to parameterization and analysis Filled with examples and exercises, with updates and supplementary materials at http://www.railsback-grimm-abm-book.com Designed for students and researchers across the biological and social sciences Written by leading {practitionersLeading} universities that have adopted this book include:  mherst {CollegeBrigham} Young {UniversityCarnegie} Mellon {UniversityMiami} {UniversityNorthwestern} {UniversityOld} Dominion {UniversityPortland} State {UniversityRhodes} {CollegeSusquehanna} {UniversityUniversity} College, {DublinUniversity} of {ArizonaUniversity} of South {FloridaUniversity} of Virginia},

In particular, the fundamental social dilemmas such as the Traveler’s dilemma, the Prisoner’s dilemma, and the Public Goods game demonstrate high rates of deviation from the unique Nash equilibrium, dependent on the game parameters or the environment in which the game is played. These results inspired several attempts to develop suitable solution concepts to more accurately explain human behaviour. In this line, the recently proposed notion of cooperative equilibrium [5, 6], based on the idea that players have a natural attitude to cooperation, has shown promising results for single-shot games. In this paper, we extend this approach to iterated settings. Specifically, we define the Iterated Cooperative Equilibrium ({ICE}) and show it makes statistically precise predictions of population average behaviour in the aforementioned domains. Importantly, the definition of {ICE} does not involve any free parameters, and so it is fully predictive.},

	abstract = {Advances in the social sciences have emerged through a variety of research methods: field-based research, laboratory and field experiments, and agent-based models. However, which research method or approach is best suited to a particular inquiry is frequently debated and discussed. Working Together examines how different methods have promoted various theoretical developments related to collective action and the commons, and demonstrates the importance of cross-fertilization involving multimethod research across traditional boundaries. The authors look at why cross-fertilization is difficult to achieve, and they show ways to overcome these challenges through collaboration.  The authors provide numerous examples of collaborative, multimethod research related to collective action and the commons. They examine the pros and cons of case studies, meta-analyses, large-N field research, experiments and modeling, and empirically grounded agent-based models, and they consider how these methods contribute to research on collective action for the management of natural resources. Using their findings, the authors outline a revised theory of collective action that includes three elements: individual decision making, microsituational conditions, and features of the broader social-ecological context.  Acknowledging the academic incentives that influence and constrain how research is conducted, Working Together reworks the theory of collective action and offers practical solutions for researchers and students across a spectrum of disciplines.},

Many real-world optimization problems of interest also have constraints which are unknown a priori. In this paper, we study Bayesian optimization for constrained problems in the general case that noise may be present in the constraint functions, and the objective and constraints may be evaluated independently. We provide motivating practical examples, and present a general framework to solve such problems. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on optimizing the performance of online latent Dirichlet allocation subject to topic sparsity constraints, tuning a neural network given test-time memory constraints, and optimizing Hamiltonian Monte Carlo to achieve maximal effectiveness in a fixed time, subject to passing standard convergence diagnostics.},

In this ground-breaking book, John Koza shows how this remarkable paradigm works and                 provides substantial empirical evidence that solutions to a great variety of                 problems from many different fields can be found by genetically breeding populations                 of computer programs. Genetic Programming contains a great many worked examples and                 includes a sample computer code that will allow readers to run their own programs.In                 getting computers to solve problems without being explicitly programmed, Koza                 stresses two points: that seemingly different problems from a variety of fields can                 be reformulated as problems of program induction, and that the recently developed                 genetic programming paradigm provides a way to search the space of possible computer                 programs for a highly fit individual computer program to solve the problems of                 program induction.

An asymmetric market-share model and a category-volume model are combined to represent market response to the actions of brand managers. The actions available to each artificial brand manager are constrained to four typical marketing actions of each from the historical data. Each brand's strategies evolve through simulations of repeated interactions in a virtual market, using the estimated weekly profits of each brand as measures of its fitness for the genetic algorithm. The artificial agents bred in this environment outperform the historical actions of brand managers in the real market. The implications of these findings for the study of marketing strategy are discussed.},

In Generative Social Science, Joshua Epstein argues that this powerful, novel technique permits the social sciences to meet a fundamentally new standard of explanation, in which one "grows" the phenomenon of interest in an artificial society of interacting agents: heterogeneous, boundedly rational actors, represented as mathematical or software objects. After elaborating this notion of generative explanation in a pair of overarching foundational chapters, Epstein illustrates it with examples chosen from such far-flung fields as archaeology, civil conflict, the evolution of norms, epidemiology, retirement economics, spatial games, and organizational adaptation. In elegant chapter preludes, he explains how these widely diverse modeling studies support his sweeping case for generative explanation. This book represents a powerful consolidation of Epstein's interdisciplinary research activities in the decade since the publication of his and Robert Axtell's landmark volume, Growing Artificial Societies. Beautifully illustrated, Generative Social Science includes a {CD} that contains animated movies of core model runs, and programs allowing users to easily change assumptions and explore models, making it an invaluable text for courses in modeling at all levels.},

	abstract = {The evolution of cooperation in network-structured populations has been a major focus of theoretical work in recent years. When players are embedded in fixed networks, cooperators are more likely to interact with, and benefit from, other cooperators. In theory, this clustering can foster cooperation on fixed networks under certain circumstances. Laboratory experiments with humans, however, have thus far found no evidence that fixed network structure actually promotes cooperation. Here, we provide such evidence and help to explain why others failed to find it. First, we show that static networks can lead to a stable high level of cooperation, outperforming well-mixed populations. We then systematically vary the benefit that cooperating provides to one’s neighbors relative to the cost required to cooperate (b/c), as well as the average number of neighbors in the network (k). When b/c {\textgreater} k, we observe high and stable levels of cooperation. Conversely, when b/c ≤ k or players are randomly shuffled, cooperation decays. Our results are consistent with a quantitative evolutionary game theoretic prediction for when cooperation should succeed on networks and, for the first time to our knowledge, provide an experimental demonstration of the power of static network structure for stabilizing human cooperation.},

In sensitivity analysis a key concern is the computational cost of the analysis, defined in terms of number of evaluations of f ( X 1 , X 2 , … , X k ) needed to complete the analysis, as f ( X 1 , X 2 , … , X k ) is often in the form of a numerical model which may take long processing time. While the computational cost is relatively cheap and weakly dependent on k for estimating first order effects, it remains expensive and strictly k-dependent for total effect indices. In the present note we compare existing and new practices for this index and offer recommendations on which to use.},

	abstract = {A goal of statistical language modeling is to learn the joint probability function of sequences of words in a language. This is intrinsically difficult because of the curse of dimensionality: a word sequence on which the model will be tested is likely to be different from all the word sequences seen during training. Traditional but very successful approaches based on n-grams obtain generalization by concatenating very short overlapping sequences seen in the training set. We propose to fight the curse of dimensionality by learning a distributed representation for words which allows each training sentence to inform the model about an exponential number of semantically neighboring sentences. The model learns simultaneously (1) a distributed representation for each word along with (2) the probability function for word sequences, expressed in terms of these representations. Generalization is obtained because a sequence of words that has never been seen before gets high probability if it is made of words that are similar (in the sense of having a nearby representation) to words forming an already seen sentence. Training such large models (with millions of parameters) within a reasonable time is itself a significant challenge. We report on experiments using neural networks for the probability function, showing on two text corpora that the proposed approach significantly improves on state-of-the-art n-gram models, and that the proposed approach allows to take advantage of longer contexts.},

Instead of assuming a population of constant size, as in most of the previous work on the Y chromosome, we consider a model which permits a period of recent population growth. We show that for most of the populations in our sample this model fits the data far better than a model with no growth. We estimate the demographic parameters of this model for each population and also the time to the most recent common ancestor. Since there is some uncertainty about the details of the microsatellite mutation process, we consider several plausible mutation schemes and estimate the variance in mutation size simultaneously with the demographic parameters of interest. Our finding of a recent common ancestor (probably in the last 120,000 years), coupled with a strong signal of demographic expansion in all populations, suggests either a recent human expansion from a small ancestral population, or natural selection acting on the Y chromosome.},

Previous work has shown that this redundancy has a negative impact on the quality of text mining and topic modeling in particular. In this paper we describe a novel variant of Latent Dirichlet Allocation ({LDA}) topic modeling, Red-{LDA}, which takes into account the inherent redundancy of patient records when modeling content of clinical notes. To assess the value of Red-{LDA}, we experiment with three baselines and our novel redundancy-aware topic modeling method: given a large collection of patient records, (i) apply vanilla {LDA} to all documents in all input records; (ii) identify and remove all redundancy by chosing a single representative document for each record as input to {LDA}; (iii) identify and remove all redundant paragraphs in each record, leaving partial, non-redundant documents as input to {LDA}; and (iv) apply Red-{LDA} to all documents in all input records. Both quantitative evaluation carried out through log-likelihood on held-out data and topic coherence of produced topics and qualitative assessement of topics carried out by physicians show that Red-{LDA} produces superior models to all three baseline strategies. This research contributes to the emerging field of understanding the characteristics of the electronic health record and how to account for them in the framework of data mining. The code for the two redundancy-elimination baselines and Red-{LDA} is made publicly available to the community.},

The many demonstrations that uncertainties can only combine according to the rules of the probability calculus are summarized. The conclusion is that statistical inference is firmly based on probability alone. Progress is therefore dependent on the construction of a probability model; methods for doing this are considered. It is argued that the probabilities are personal. The roles of likelihood and exchangeability are explained. Inference is only of value if it can be used, so the extension to decision analysis, incorporating utility, is related to risk and to the use of statistics in science and law.

	abstract = {In 1991 Morris proposed an effective screening sensitivity measure to identify the few important factors in models with many factors. The method is based on computing for each input a number of incremental ratios, namely elementary effects, which are then averaged to assess the overall importance of the input. Despite its value, the method is still rarely used and instead local analyses varying one factor at a time around a baseline point are usually employed.

In this piece of work we propose a revised version of the elementary effects method, improved in terms of both the definition of the measure and the sampling strategy. In the present form the method shares many of the positive qualities of the variance-based techniques, having the advantage of a lower computational cost, as demonstrated by the analytical examples.

The method is employed to assess the sensitivity of a chemical reaction model for dimethylsulphide ({DMS}), a gas involved in climate change. Results of the sensitivity analysis open up the ground for model reconsideration: some model components may need a more thorough modelling effort while some others may need to be simplified.},

The probabilistic outputs contrast with common methods that estimate conservation action effectiveness as a product of typical (average) characteristics for disaggregated customer groups. Implications to size water conservation programs to meet conservation objectives and target customers to adopt conservation actions are discussed.},

	abstract = {A computational model is a representation of some physical or other system of interest, first expressed mathematically and then implemented in the form of a computer program; it may be viewed as a function of inputs that, when evaluated, produces outputs. Motivation for this article comes from computational models that are deterministic, complicated enough to make classical mathematical analysis impractical and that have a moderate-to-large number of inputs. The problem of designing computational experiments to determine which inputs have important effects on an output is considered. The proposed experimental plans are composed of individually randomized one-factor-at-a-time designs, and data analysis is based on the resulting random sample of observed elementary effects, those changes in an output due solely to changes in a particular input. Advantages of this approach include a lack of reliance on assumptions of relative sparsity of important inputs, monotonicity of outputs with respect to inputs, or adequacy of a low-order polynomial as an approximation to the computational model.},

This article investigates the effect a signed water treaty has on later water-specific cooperation in a dyad. An analysis is conducted for all international river basins in the world for the period 1948–1999. Using data on international rivers, river treaties, and cooperative water events, the results show that river treaties indeed are successful in promoting water cooperation.},

Communicating these uncertainties is important for decision making on robust adaptation strategies, but proves to be a challenge for scientists particularly because of the complexity of uncertainties that are part of natural variability and of human induced climate change. The aim of this paper is to assess the role of a simulation game, as intermediate, to the communication of climate change uncertainties to water managers. In three workshops with water managers, the simulation game ‘Sustainable Delta’ was played to test the influence of the game on their understanding of climate change uncertainty using ex ante and ex post surveys. In each workshop an experimental- and control group were given different assignments to measure the influence of the game. The results show that although the differences between groups were not statistically significant, a change in their understanding of uncertainties was observed. The paper concludes that the learning effect of the game is inconclusive, but that the game does fosters a broader understanding of the concept climate change uncertainty. In doing so, simulation games are a promising approach to support the communication of climate change uncertainties meaningfully and support the process of adaptation to an uncertain future.},

Though theoretical and empirical evidence suggests that markets do often outperform alternative mechanisms, less attention has been paid to the magnitude of improvement. Here we compare the performance of prediction markets to conventional methods of prediction, namely polls and statistical models. Examining thousands of sporting and movie events, we find that the relative advantage of prediction markets is surprisingly small, as measured by squared error, calibration, and discrimination. Moreover, these domains also exhibit remarkably steep diminishing returns to information, with nearly all the predictive power captured by only two or three parameters. As policy makers consider adoption of prediction markets, costs should be weighed against potentially modest benefits.},

The implementation in an industrial setting with the potential of affecting and being visible to real users made it necessary to overcome a host of practical challenges. We present a spectrum of topic modeling techniques that contribute to a deployed system. These include non-topical tweet detection, automatic labeled data acquisition, evaluation with human computation, diagnostic and corrective learning and, most importantly, high-precision topic inference. The latter represents a novel two-stage training algorithm for tweet text classification and a close-loop inference mechanism for combining texts with additional sources of information. The resulting system achieves 93\% precision at substantial overall coverage.},

Findings indicate that households with lower water usage display greater awareness of water conservation issues, are more highly involved in the decision to use water, and tend to form habits associated with lower usage levels. Furthermore, the results are consistent with past research that attitudes toward water usage appear to be poor predictors of water consumption behavior. After controlling for situational factors (e.g., household size), the findings substantiate the role of personal involvement and habit formation in explaining water consumption, lending further support to the adaptation and development of repeated behavior models in environmental psychology.},

This paper provides empirical data based on water consumption measurements in 81 households. With the help of a simultaneous webcam observation of the kitchen sink, it was possible to assign the metered consumption data to a specific water use, such as cleaning, drinking or cooking. Water end-use has been analysed with this approach at a very deep level. The study shows that there are, in some measure, large country-specific differences in diurnal water use, as well as in the composition of kitchen activities. Furthermore, the research findings indicate that small households use much more water per person and day than bigger households. This is rather important as demographic shifts are causing a decreased average household size - particularly in urban areas - and, therewith, a growing demand. Water-saving measures at the household and individual level should meet this trend. This paper, therefore, also provides information on to what extent particular kitchen tasks are influential for water consumption in the kitchen, respectively, which activities are important to concentrate on for consumer advice regarding water conservation.},

	abstract = {Over the last twenty or so years, it has become standard to require policy makers to base their recommendations on evidence. That is now uncontroversial to the point of triviality--of course, policy should be based on the facts. But are the methods that policy makers rely on to gather and analyze evidence the right ones? In Evidence-Based Policy, Nancy Cartwright, an eminent scholar, and Jeremy Hardie, who has had a long and successful career in both business and the economy, explain that the dominant methods which are in use now--broadly speaking, methods that imitate standard practices in medicine like randomized control trials--do not work. They fail, Cartwright and Hardie contend, because they do not enhance our ability to predict if policies will be effective.The prevailing methods fall short not just because social science, which operates within the domain of real-world politics and deals with people, differs so much from the natural science milieu of the lab. Rather, there are principled reasons why the advice for crafting and implementing policy now on offer will lead to bad results. Current guides in use tend to rank scientific methods according to the degree of trustworthiness of the evidence they produce. That is valuable in certain respects, but such approaches offer little advice about how to think about putting such evidence to use. Evidence-Based Policy focuses on showing policymakers how to effectively use evidence, explaining what types of information are most necessary for making reliable policy, and offers lessons on how to organize that information.},

Such simulation provides an ideal environment for intelligent agents to learn to perform their tasks before being deployed in a real-world environment. The presented research investigates theoretical and practical aspects of learning by autonomous agents within stochastic agent-based simulation. The theoretical work is based on the Inferential Theory of Learning, which describes learning processes from the perspective of a learner’s goal as a search through knowledge space. The theory is extended for approximate and probabilistic learning to account for the situations encountered when learning in stochastic environments. Practical aspects are exemplified by two use cases in autonomous logistics: learning predictive models for environment conditions in the future, and learning in the context of evolutionary plan optimization.},

The end-use model is based on statistical information of users and end-uses: census data such as the number of people per household and their ages; the frequency of use; duration and flow per water-use event; occurrence over the day for different end-uses such as flushing the toilet, doing the laundry, washing hands, etc. With this approach, water demand patterns can be simulated. The simulation results were compared to measured water demand patterns on attributes such as peak flow and daily total water use, as well as on the shape of the pattern and the frequency distribution of flows and accelerations in flow. The simulation results show a good correspondence to measured water demands. Because the end-use model is based on statistical information rather than flow measurements, the model is transferable to diverse residential areas in different countries. The model can be applied in the design stage (prebuild), in scenario studies, and in water quality distribution network models.},

	abstract = {Agent-based modeling and simulation ({ABMS}), a way to simulate a large number of choices by individual actors, is one of the most exciting practical developments in business modeling since the invention of relational databases. It represents a new way to understand data and generate information that has never been available before--a way for businesses to view the future and to understand and anticipate the likely effects of their decisions on their markets and industries. It thus promises to have far-reaching effects on the way that businesses in many areas use computers to support practical decision-making.Managing Business Complexity is the first complete business-oriented agent-based modeling and simulation resource. It has three purposes: first, to teach readers how to think about {ABMS}, that is, about agents and their interactions; second, to teach readers how to explain the features and advantages of {ABMS} to other people and third, to teach readers how to actually implement {ABMS} by building agent-based simulations. It is intended to be a complete {ABMS} resource, accessible to readers who haven't had any previous experience in building agent-based simulations, or any other kinds of models, for that matter. It is also a collection of {ABMS} business applications resources, all assembled in one place for the first time. In short, Managing Business Complexity addresses who needs {ABMS} and why, where and when {ABMS} can be applied to the everyday business problems that surround us, and how specifically to build these powerful agent-based models.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to disaggregate water flow data collected from high resolution smart water meters into different water end use categories. The data was obtained from a sample of 252 residential dwellings located within South East Queensland ({SEQ}), Australia. An integrated approach was used, combining high resolution water meters, remote data transfer loggers, household water appliance audits and a self-reported household water use diary. Disaggregating water flow traces into a registry of end use events (e.g. shower, clothes washer, etc.) is predominately a complex pattern matching problem, which requires a comparison between presented patterns and those contained with a large registry of categorised end use events. Water flow data collected directly from water meters includes both single (e.g. shower event occurring alone) and combined events (i.e. an event which comprises of several overlapped single events). To identify these former mentioned single events, a hybrid combination of the Hidden Markov Model ({HMM}) and the Dynamic Time Warping algorithm ({DTW}) provided the most feasible and accurate approach available. Additional end use event physical context algorithms have been developed to aid accurate end use event categorisation. This paper firstly presents a thorough discussion on the single water end use event analysis process developed and its internal validation with a testing set. This is followed by the application of the developed approach on three independent households to examine its degree of accuracy in disaggregating two weeks of residential flow data into a repository of residential water end use events. Future stages of algorithm development and testing is discussed in the final section.},

	abstract = {Bayesian methods are useful in the simulation context for several reasons. They provide a convenient and useful way to represent uncertainty about alternatives (like manufacturing system designs, service operations, or other simulation applications) in a way that quantifies uncertainty about the performance of systems, or about inputs parameters of those systems. They also can be used to improve the efficiency of discrete optimization with simulation and response surface methods. Bayesian methods work well with other decision theoretic tools, and can therefore provide a link from traditional operations-level experiments to higher-level managerial decision-making needs, in addition to improving the efficiency of computer experiments},

	abstract = {Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund \& R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148–156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

	shorttitle = {Prediction error estimation},
	abstract = {Motivation: In genomic studies, thousands of features are collected on relatively few samples. One of the goals of these studies is to build classifiers to predict the outcome of future observations. There are three inherent steps to this process: feature selection, model selection and prediction assessment. With a focus on prediction assessment, we compare several methods for estimating the ‘true’ prediction error of a prediction model in the presence of feature selection.
Results: For small studies where features are selected from thousands of candidates, the resubstitution and simple split-sample estimates are seriously biased. In these small samples, leave-one-out cross-validation ({LOOCV}), 10-fold cross-validation ({CV}) and the .632+ bootstrap have the smallest bias for diagonal discriminant analysis, nearest neighbor and classification trees. {LOOCV} and 10-fold {CV} have the smallest bias for linear discriminant analysis. Additionally, {LOOCV}, 5- and 10-fold {CV}, and the .632+ bootstrap have the lowest mean square error. The .632+ bootstrap is quite biased in small sample sizes with strong signal-to-noise ratios. Differences in performance among resampling methods are reduced as the number of specimens available increase.

Here we extend the standard framework to include costly punishment. Now players have a choice between cooperation, defection and costly punishment. We study the set of all reactive strategies, where the behavior depends on what the other player has done in the previous round. We find all cooperative strategies that are Nash equilibria. If the cost of cooperation is greater than the cost of punishment, then the only cooperative Nash equilibrium is generous-tit-for-tat ({GTFT}), which does not use costly punishment. If the cost of cooperation is less than the cost of punishment, then there are infinitely many cooperative Nash equilibria and the response to defection can include costly punishment. We also perform computer simulations of evolutionary dynamics in populations of finite size. These simulations show that in the context of direct reciprocity, (i) natural selection prefers generous tit-for-tat over strategies that use costly punishment, and (ii) that costly punishment does not promote the evolution of cooperation. We find quantitative agreement between our simulation results and data from experimental observations.},

	shorttitle = {Applications of Automata Theory and Algebra},
	abstract = {This book was originally written in 1969 by Berkeley mathematician John Rhodes. It is the founding work in what is now called algebraic engineering, an emerging field created by using the unifying scheme of finite state machine models and their complexity to tie together many fields: finite group theory, semigroup theory, automata and sequential machine theory, finite phase space physics, metabolic and evolutionary biology, epistemology, mathematical theory of psychoanalysis, philosophy, and game theory. The author thus introduced a completely original algebraic approach to complexity and the understanding of finite systems. The unpublished manuscript, often referred to as "The Wild Book", became an underground classic, continually requested in manuscript form, and read by many leading researchers in mathematics, complex systems, artificial intelligence, and systems biology. Yet it has never been available in print until now. This first published edition has been edited and updated by Chrystopher Nehaniv for the 21st century. Its novel and rigorous development of the mathematical theory of complexity via algebraic automata theory reveals deep and unexpected connections between algebra (semigroups) and areas of science and engineering. Co-founded by John Rhodes and Kenneth Krohn in 1962, algebraic automata theory has grown into a vibrant area of research, including the complexity of automata, and semigroups and machines from an algebraic viewpoint, and which also touches on infinite groups, and other areas of algebra. This book sets the stage for the application of algebraic automata theory to areas outside mathematics. The material and references have been brought up-to-date by the editor as much as possible, yet the book retains its distinct character and the bold yet rigorous style of the author. Included are treatments of topics such as models of time as algebra via semigroup theory; evolution-complexity relations applicable to both ontogeny and evolution; an approach to classification of biological reactions and pathways; the relationships among coordinate systems, symmetry, and conservation principles in physics; discussion of punctuated equilibrium (prior to Stephen Jay Gould); games; and applications to psychology, psychoanalysis, epistemology, and the purpose of life. The approach and contents will be of interest to a variety of researchers and students in algebra as well as to the diverse, growing areas of applications of algebra in science and engineering. Moreover, many parts of the book will be intelligible to non-mathematicians, including students and experts from diverse backgrounds.},

use an efficient model representation and a genetic algorithm-based estimation process to generate simple
approximations that explain most of the structure of complex stochastic processes. This method, implemented
in C++ and R, scales well to large data sets. We apply our methods to empirical data from human subjects
game experiments and international relations. We also demonstrate the method’s ability to recover known
data-generating processes by simulating data with agent-based models and correctly deriving the underlying
decision models for multiple agent models and degrees of stochasticity.},

However, epistemic uncertainty regarding the exact nature of biological systems can complicate the calibration of models and simulations that attempt to capture their structure and behaviour, and can obscure the interpretation of simulation-derived experimental results with respect to the real domain. We present an approach to the calibration of an agent-based model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis ({EAE}), a mouse proxy for multiple sclerosis ({MS}), which harnesses interaction between a modeller and domain expert in mitigating uncertainty in the data derived from the real domain. A novel uncertainty analysis technique is presented that, in conjunction with a latin hypercube-based global sensitivity analysis, can indicate the implications of epistemic uncertainty in the real domain. These analyses may be considered in the context of domain-specific knowledge to qualify the certainty placed on the results of in silico experimentation.},

	abstract = {The research project {GLOWA}-Danube, financed by the German Federal Government, is investigating long-term changes in the water cycle of the upper Danube river basin (77,000 km2) in light of global climatic change. Its aim is to build a fully integrated decision-support tool “{DANUBIA}” that combines the competence of 11 different research institutes in domains covering all major aspects governing the water cycle—from the formation of clouds, to groundwater flow patterns, to the behaviour of the water consumer. Both the influence of natural changes in the ecosystem, such as climate change, and changes in human behaviour, such as changes in land use or water consumption, are considered. {DANUBIA} is comprised of 15 individual disciplinary models that are connected via customized interfaces that facilitate network-based parallel calculations. The strictly object-oriented {DANUBIA} architecture was developed using the graphical notation tool {UML} (Unified Modeling Language) and has been implemented in Java code. All models use the same spatial discretisation for the exchange of data (1 × 1 km grid cells) but are using different time steps. The representation of a vast number of relevant physical and social processes that occur at different spatial and temporal scales is a very demanding task. Newly developed up- and downscaling procedures [Rojanschi, V., 2001. Effects of upscaling for a finite-difference flow model. Master’s Thesis, Institut für Wasserbau, Universität Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany] and a sophisticated time controller developed by the computer sciences group [Hennicker, R., Barth, M., Kraus, A., Ludwig, M., 2002. {DANUBIA}: A Web-based modelling and decision support system for integrative global change research in the upper Danube basin. In: {GSF} (Ed.), {GLOWA}, German Program on Global Change in the Hydrological Cycle Status Report 2002. {GSF}, Munich, pp. 35–38; Kraus, A., Ludwig, M., 2003. {GLOWA}-Danube Papers Technical Release No. 002 (Danubia Framework), Software-Release No.: 0.9.2, Documentation Version: 0.10, Release Date: 27 March 2003] are required to solve the emerging problems. After a first successful public demonstration of the {DANUBIA} package (nine models) in May 2002 [Mauser, W., Stolz, R., Colgan, A., 2002. {GLOWA}-Danube: integrative techniques, scenarios and strategies regarding global change of the water cycle. In: {GSF} (Ed.), {GLOWA}, German Program on Global Change in the Hydrological Cycle (Phase I, 2000–2003) Status Report 2002. {GSF}, Munich, pp. 31–34], the research consortium is now preparing a first validation run of {DANUBIA} for the period 1995–1999 with all 15 models. After successful completion of the validation, a scenario run based on {IPCC} climate scenarios [{IPCC}, 2001. Climate Change 2001: Synthesis Report. In: Watson, R.T., Core Writing Team (Eds.), A Contribution of Working Groups I, {II}, and {III} to the Third Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, {UK} and New York, {NY}, {USA}, 398pp] for a five year period between 2025 and 2040 will follow at the end of 2003.

The research group “Groundwater and Water Resources Management” at the Institute of Hydraulic Engineering, Universität Stuttgart, is contributing both a three-dimensional groundwater flow model of the catchment and an agent-based model for simulating water supply and distribution. This paper gives a general overview of the {GLOWA}-Danube project and describes the groundwater modeling segment. Nickel et al. deal with the water supply model in a second contribution to this special issue.

A three-dimensional numerical groundwater flow model consisting of four main layers has been developed and is in a continual state of refinement ({MODFLOW}, [{McDonald}, M.G., Harbaugh, A.W., 1988. A modular three-dimensional finite-difference ground-water flow model: {US} Geological Survey Techniques of Water-Resources Investigations, Washington, {USA} (book 6, Chapter A1)]). One main research focus has been on the investigation of upscaling techniques to meet the requirement of a fixed 1 × 1 km cell size. This cell size is compulsory for all models in {DANUBIA} in order to facilitate a one to one parameter exchange. In a second stage, a transport model (nitrogen) will be added ({MT}3D: [Zheng, C., Hathaway, D.-L., 1991. {MT}3D: a new modular three-dimensional transport model and its application in predicting the persistence and transport of dissolved compounds from a gasoline spill, with implications for remediation.

	abstract = {Complex mathematical and computational models are used in all areas of society and technology and yet model based science is increasingly contested or refuted, especially when models are applied to controversial themes in domains such as health, the environment or the economy. More stringent standards of proofs are demanded from model-based numbers, especially when these numbers represent potential financial losses, threats to human health or the state of the environment. Quantitative sensitivity analysis is generally agreed to be one such standard.Mathematical models are good at mapping assumptions into inferences. A modeller makes assumptions about laws pertaining to the system, about its status and a plethora of other, often arcane, system variables and internal model settings. To what extent can we rely on the model-based inference when most of these assumptions are fraught with uncertainties? Global Sensitivity Analysis offers an accessible treatment of such problems via  quantitative sensitivity analysis, beginning with the first principles and guiding the reader through the full range of recommended practices with a rich set of solved exercises. The text explains the motivation for sensitivity analysis, reviews the required statistical concepts, and provides a guide to potential applications.The book:Provides a self-contained treatment of the subject, allowing readers to learn and practice global sensitivity analysis without further materials.Presents ways to frame the analysis, interpret its results, and avoid potential pitfalls.Features numerous exercises and solved problems to help illustrate the applications.Is authored by leading sensitivity analysis practitioners, combining a range of disciplinary backgrounds.Postgraduate students and practitioners in a wide range of subjects, including statistics, mathematics, engineering, physics, chemistry, environmental sciences, biology, toxicology, actuarial sciences, and econometrics will find much of use here. This book will prove equally valuable to engineers working on risk analysis and to financial analysts concerned with pricing and hedging.},

	abstract = {In this paper, sensitivity analysis ({SA}) has been used to assess model sensitivities to input parameter values in a water quality model. The water quality model incorporates a rainfall-runoff sub-model and a sediment load estimation sub-model, and is calibrated against hydrologic and water quality data from the Moruya River catchment in southeast Australia. The tested methods, One-at-A-Time ({OAT}), Morris Method ({MM}) and Regional {SA} ({RSA}) are found to be complementary, and help to characterise the behaviour of the water quality model. The most important parameters are plant stress threshold (f), coefficient of evapotranspiration (e), catchment moisture threshold (d), in decreasing order, indicating that sediment and nutrient loads are more sensitive to parameters that affect the magnitude of flows than those (vs, τq, τs) that control the timing and shape of the peak in a time series. But this application shows a need to be flexible in the use of different {SA} techniques. {RSA} is more appropriate for complex models where system nonlinearities and parameter interactions are more likely to be important. The {RSA} suggests that f and vs have strong interactions in the influence on nitrogen estimation. This study is also valuable for future uncertainty analysis, by separating the source of uncertainty of model parameters from the uncertainty in the model inputs.},

	abstract = {Providers of potable water to households and businesses are charged with conserving water. Addressing this challenge requires accurate information about how water is actually being used. So smart meters are being deployed on a large scale by water providers to collect medium resolution water use data. This paper presents water use signature patterns, the first technique designed for medium resolution meters for discovering patterns that explain how households use water. Signature patterns are clusters (subsets) of water meter readings specified by patterns on volumes and calendar dates. Four types of signature pattern are introduced in this paper: continuous flow days; exceptional peak use days; programmed patterns with recurrent hours; and normal use partitioned by season and period of the day. Signature patterns for each household are calculated using efficient selection rules that scale for city populations and years of data collection. Data from a real-world, large-scale, smart metering trial are analyzed using water use signature patterns. The results demonstrate that water use behaviors are distinctive, for both individuals and populations. Signatures can identify behaviors that are promising targets for water conservation. Pattern discovery can be automated with an efficient and scalable computer program. By identifying relevant consumption patterns in medium resolution meter data, water use signature patterns can help to achieve the water conservation potential of large-scale smart metering.},

We present an alternative, semiautomated approach, the structural topic model ({STM}) (Roberts, Stewart, and Airoldi 2013; Roberts et al. 2013), that draws on recent developments in machine learning based analysis of textual data. A crucial contribution of the method is that it incorporates information about the document, such as the author's gender, political affiliation, and treatment assignment (if an experimental study). This article focuses on how the {STM} is helpful for survey researchers and experimentalists. The {STM} makes analyzing open-ended responses easier, more revealing, and capable of being used to estimate treatment effects. We illustrate these innovations with analysis of text from surveys and experiments.},

Predicting rainfall deficits in this region on seasonal and decadal time frames can help decision makers implement disaster risk reduction measures while guiding climate-smart adaptation and agricultural development. Building on recent research that links more frequent droughts in that region to a stronger Walker Circulation, warming in the Indo-Pacific warm pool, and an increased western Pacific sea surface temperature ({SST}) gradient, we show that the two dominant modes of East African boreal spring rainfall variability are tied, respectively, to western-central Pacific and central Indian Ocean {SST}.  Variations in these rainfall modes can be predicted using two previously defined {SST} indices – the West Pacific Gradient ({WPG}) and Central Indian Ocean index ({CIO}), with the {WPG} and {CIO} being used, respectively, to predict the first and second rainfall modes. These simple indices can be used in concert with more sophisticated coupled modeling systems and land surface data assimilations to help inform early warning and guide climate outlooks.},

	abstract = {In ‘experience-weighted attraction’ ({EWA}) learning, strategies have attractions that reflect initial predispositions, are updated based on payoff experience, and determine choice probabilities according to some rule (e.g., logit). A key feature is a parameter δ that weights the strength of hypothetical reinforcement of strategies that were not chosen according to the payoff they would have yielded, relative to reinforcement of chosen strategies according to received payoffs. The other key features are two discount rates, φ and ρ, which separately discount previous attractions, and an experience weight. {EWA} includes reinforcement learning and weighted fictitious play (belief learning) as special cases, and hybridizes their key elements. When δ= 0 and ρ= 0, cumulative choice reinforcement results. When δ= 1 and ρ=φ, levels of reinforcement of strategies are exactly the same as expected payoffs given weighted fictitious play beliefs. Using three sets of experimental data, parameter estimates of the model were calibrated on part of the data and used to predict a holdout sample. Estimates of δ are generally around .50, φ around .8 − 1, and ρ varies from 0 to φ. Reinforcement and belief-learning special cases are generally rejected in favor of {EWA}, though belief models do better in some constant-sum games. {EWA} is able to combine the best features of previous approaches, allowing attractions to begin and grow flexibly as choice reinforcement does, but reinforcing unchosen strategies substantially as belief-based models implicitly do.},

We are able to illustrate a simple principle: genetic algorithms can be implemented so that they represent pure learning effects (i.e., beliefs updating based on realizations of endogenous variables in an environment with heterogeneous beliefs). Agents optimally solve their maximization problem at each date given their beliefs at each date. We report the results of a set of computational experiments in which we find that our population of artificial adaptive agents is usually able to coordinate their beliefs so as to achieve the Pareto superior rational expectations equilibrium of the model.},

Each participant chooses how much to contribute to a common pool that returns benefits to all participants equally. The ideal outcome occurs if everybody contributes the maximum amount, but the self-interested strategy is not to contribute anything. Most previous studies have found punishment to be more effective than reward for maintaining cooperation in public goods games. The typical design of these studies, however, represses future consequences for today’s actions. In an experimental setting, we compare public goods games followed by punishment, reward, or both in the setting of truly repeated games, in which player identities persist from round to round. We show that reward is as effective as punishment for maintaining public cooperation and leads to higher total earnings. Moreover, when both options are available, reward leads to increased contributions and payoff, whereas punishment has no effect on contributions and leads to lower payoff. We conclude that reward outperforms punishment in repeated public goods games and that human cooperation in such repeated settings is best supported by positive interactions with others.},

	abstract = {The Prisoner's Dilemma has been a subject of extensive research due to its importance in understanding the ever-present tension between individual self-interest and social benefit. A strictly dominant strategy in a Prisoner's Dilemma (defection), when played by both players, is mutually harmful. Repetition of the Prisoner's Dilemma can give rise to cooperation as an equilibrium, but defection is as well, and this ambiguity is difficult to resolve. The numerous behavioral experiments investigating the Prisoner's Dilemma highlight that players often cooperate, but the level of cooperation varies significantly with the specifics of the experimental predicament. We present the first computational model of human behavior in repeated Prisoner's Dilemma games that unifies the diversity of experimental observations in a systematic and quantitatively reliable manner. Our model relies on data we integrated from many experiments, comprising 168,386 individual decisions. The computational model is composed of two pieces: the first predicts the first-period action using solely the structural game parameters, while the second predicts dynamic actions using both game parameters and history of play. Our model is extremely successful not merely at fitting the data, but in predicting behavior at multiple scales in experimental designs not used for calibration, using only information about the game structure.

	abstract = {A key aspect of effective public planning design is to minimize the impact of negative outcomes that can arise from the violation of pre-established system constraint criteria. These planning situations can be especially complicated when several components within the studied system are either unknown or contain considerable stochastic uncertainty. In this paper, the concept of outcome minimization through the use of penalty functions is combined with grey programming ({GP}) into an evolutionary simulation-optimization ({ESO}) procedure in order to solve solid waste management problems containing significant sources of uncertainty. By employing outcome minimization concurrently with {GP} and {ESO}, it can be shown that plans that meet, or come close to meeting, required system criteria can be efficiently created. The efficacy of the procedure is demonstrated through its application to a solid waste planning case from the Municipality of Hamilton–Wentworth in the Province of Ontario, Canada. Since {ESO} techniques can be adapted to a wide variety of problem types in which some or all of the system components are stochastic, the practicality of this approach can be adapted to many operational and strategic planning situations containing significant sources of uncertainty.},

	shorttitle = {Explaining host–parasitoid interactions at the landscape scale},
	abstract = {Linking spatial pattern and process is a difficult task in landscape ecology because spatial patterns of populations result from complex factors such as individual traits, the spatio-temporal variation of the habitat, and the relationships between the target species and other species. Mechanistic models provide tools to bridge this gap but they are seldom used to study the influence of landscape patterns on biological processes. In this paper, we develop a methodological approach based on sensitivity and multivariate analyses to investigate the relationship between the biological parameters of species and landscape characteristics. As a case study, we used a tritrophic system that includes a host plant (oilseed rape, Brassica napus L.), a pest of the host plant (the pollen beetle, Meligethes aeneus F.), and the main parasitoid of the pest (Tersilochus heterocerus). This tritrophic system was recently represented by a model (Mosaic-Pest) that is spatially explicit at the landscape scale and that includes 32 biological parameters. In the current study, model simulations were compared with observed data from 35 landscapes differing in configuration. Sensitivity analysis using the Morris method identified those biological parameters that were highly sensitive to landscape configuration. Then, multivariate analyses revealed how a parameter’s influence on model output could be affected by landscape composition. Comparison of simulated and observed data helped us decrease the uncertainty surrounding the estimated values of the literature-derived parameters describing beetle dispersal and stage transition of the parasitoid at emergence. The advantages of using multivariate sensitivity analyses to disentangle the links between patterns and processes in landscape-scale spatially explicit models are discussed.},

	abstract = {The origin of large but rare cascades that are triggered by small initial shocks is a phenomenon that manifests itself as diversely as cultural fads, collective action, the diffusion of norms and innovations, and cascading failures in infrastructure and organizational networks. This paper presents a possible explanation of this phenomenon in terms of a sparse, random network of interacting agents whose decisions are determined by the actions of their neighbors according to a simple threshold rule. Two regimes are identified in which the network is susceptible to very large cascades—herein called global cascades—that occur very rarely. When cascade propagation is limited by the connectivity of the network, a power law distribution of cascade sizes is observed, analogous to the cluster size distribution in standard percolation theory and avalanches in self-organized criticality. But when the network is highly connected, cascade propagation is limited instead by the local stability of the nodes themselves, and the size distribution of cascades is bimodal, implying a more extreme kind of instability that is correspondingly harder to anticipate. In the first regime, where the distribution of network neighbors is highly skewed, it is found that the most connected nodes are far more likely than average nodes to trigger cascades, but not in the second regime. Finally, it is shown that heterogeneity plays an ambiguous role in determining a system's stability: increasingly heterogeneous thresholds make the system more vulnerable to global cascades; but an increasingly heterogeneous degree distribution makes it less vulnerable.},

Non-mathematical readers will appreciate the intuitive explanations of the techniques while an emphasis on problem-solving with real data across a wide variety of applications will aid practitioners who wish to extend their expertise. Readers should have knowledge of basic statistical ideas, such as correlation and linear regression analysis. While the text is biased against complex equations, a mathematical background is needed for advanced topics.Dr. Kuhn is a Director of Non-Clinical Statistics at Pfizer Global R\&D in Groton Connecticut. He has been applying predictive models in the pharmaceutical and diagnostic industries for over 15 years and is the author of a number of R packages. Dr. Johnson has more than a decade of statistical consulting and predictive modeling experience in pharmaceutical research and development.  He is a co-founder of Arbor Analytics, a firm specializing in predictive modeling and is a former Director of Statistics at Pfizer Global R\&D.  His scholarly work centers on the application and development of statistical methodology and learning algorithms.Applied Predictive Modeling covers the overall predictive modeling process, beginning with the crucial steps of data preprocessing, data splitting and foundations of model tuning.  The text then provides intuitive explanations of numerous common and modern regression and classification techniques, always with an emphasis on illustrating and solving real data problems.  Addressing practical concerns extends beyond model fitting to topics such as handling class imbalance, selecting predictors, and pinpointing causes of poor model performance—all of which are problems that occur frequently in practice. The text illustrates all parts of the modeling process through many hands-on, real-life examples.  And every chapter contains extensive R code for each step of the process.  The data sets and corresponding code are available in the book’s companion {AppliedPredictiveModeling} R package, which is freely available on the {CRAN} archive. This multi-purpose text can be used as an introduction to predictive models and the overall modeling process, a practitioner’s reference handbook, or as a text for advanced undergraduate or graduate level predictive modeling courses.  To that end, each chapter contains problem sets to help solidify the covered concepts and uses data available in the book’s R package. Readers and students interested in implementing the methods should have some basic knowledge of R.  And a handful of the more advanced topics require some mathematical knowledge.},

The method fits naturally in the Bayesian inferential framework, and a brief overview is given of the key concepts. Three main approaches to {ABC} have been developed, and these are described and compared.

	abstract = {An Introduction to Statistical Learning provides an accessible overview of the field of statistical learning, an essential toolset for making sense of the vast and complex data sets that have emerged in fields ranging from biology to finance to marketing to astrophysics in the past twenty years. This book presents some of the most important modeling and prediction techniques, along with relevant applications. Topics include linear regression, classification, resampling methods, shrinkage approaches, tree-based methods, support vector machines, clustering, and more. Color graphics and real-world examples are used to illustrate the methods presented. Since the goal of this textbook is to facilitate the use of these statistical learning techniques by practitioners in science, industry, and other fields, each chapter contains a tutorial on implementing the analyses and methods presented in R, an extremely popular open source statistical software platform.Two of the authors co-wrote The Elements of Statistical Learning (Hastie, Tibshirani and Friedman, 2nd edition 2009), a popular reference book for statistics and machine learning researchers. An Introduction to Statistical Learning covers many of the same topics, but at a level accessible to a much broader audience. This book is targeted at statisticians and non-statisticians alike who wish to use cutting-edge statistical learning techniques to analyze their data. The text assumes only a previous course in linear regression and no knowledge of matrix algebra.},

Risk analysis consists of four basic analytical modules – hazard, exposure, vulnerability and risk to determine risk metrics. Risk metrics are losses corresponding to different return periods and their likelihood derived from stochastic evaluations of historical and simulated loss data – this process is called risk profiling for a given natural hazard in a given region. The U.S. Agency for International Development ({USAID}) funded Famine Early Warning Systems Network ({FEWS} {NET}) has been monitoring food security issues in the sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and Central America and in Haiti. {FEWS} {NET} uses satellite based rainfall and climatic water demands to monitor moisture availability conditions for deriving food security status in Africa. This paper highlights the results of agricultural drought risk profiling analyses for maize in Malawi and Mozambique in Southern Africa, and for millet in Niger in West Sahel. Historical maize and millet yields have been analyzed to develop drought vulnerability models using the satellite rainfall based-water requirement satisfaction index ({WRSI}) in the above countries. In view of the limited hazard and exposure data (2000 to present) long-term synthetic rainfall time series were generated. The loss exceedance probability ({LEP}) curves, return period losses and drought frequency maps indicating district-level drought-proneness for the target crops in the selected countries have been generated.},

Modelers have moved from ‘proofs of existence’ toy models to case-specific, multi-scaled, multi-actor, and data-intensive models of land-use and land-cover change. An international workshop, titled ‘Multi-Agent Modeling and Collaborative Planning—Method2Method Workshop’, was held in Bonn in 2005 in order to bring together researchers using different data collection approaches to informing agent-based models. Participants identified a typology of five approaches to empirically inform {ABMs} for land use science: sample surveys, participant observation, field and laboratory experiments, companion modeling, and {GIS} and remotely sensed data. This paper reviews these five approaches to informing {ABMs}, provides a corresponding case study describing the model usage of these approaches, the types of data each approach produces, the types of questions those data can answer, and an evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses of those data for use in an {ABM}.},

Screening assumes that only a few factors are really important (parsimony principle). This paper solves the screening problem by a novel technique called ‘sequential bifurcation’. This technique is both effective and efficient; that is, it does find all important factors, yet it requires relatively few simulation runs. The technique is demonstrated through a realistic case study, concerning a complicated simulation model, called ‘{IMAGE}’. This simulation models the greenhouse phenomenon (the worldwide increase of temperatures). This case study gives surprising results: the technique identifies some factors as being important that the ecological experts initially thought to be unimportant. Sequential bifurcation assumes that the input/output behavior of the simulation model may be approximated by a first-order polynomial (main effects), possibly augmented with interactions between factors. The technique is sequential; that is, it specifies and analyzes simulation runs, one after the other.},

The land use change model simulates the annual expansion of an urban area according to planners’ guidelines; the sewage system simulator investigates the response of the drainage system to the expansion. The wastewater treatment plant is simulated in order to assess the impact of the new outflows on the existing plant. The three models are integrated into a Simulink model. Two components of the developed framework are based on models well established in literature. The proposed framework is tested on a simple case study of a small town located in south west of Scotland.},

	shorttitle = {Bounded Rationality},
	abstract = {In a complex and uncertain world, humans and animals make decisions under                 the constraints of limited knowledge, resources, and time. Yet models of rational                 decision making in economics, cognitive science, biology, and other fields largely                 ignore these real constraints and instead assume agents with perfect information and                 unlimited time. About forty years ago, Herbert Simon challenged this view with his                 notion of "bounded rationality." Today, bounded rationality has become a fashionable                 term used for disparate views of reasoning.This book promotes                 bounded rationality as the key to understanding how real people make decisions.                 Using the concept of an "adaptive toolbox," a repertoire of fast and frugal rules                 for decision making under uncertainty, it attempts to impose more order and                 coherence on the idea of bounded rationality. The contributors view bounded                 rationality neither as optimization under constraints nor as the study of people's                 reasoning fallacies. The strategies in the adaptive toolbox dispense with                 optimization and, for the most part, with calculations of probabilities and                 utilities. The book extends the concept of bounded rationality from cognitive tools                 to emotions; it analyzes social norms, imitation, and other cultural tools as                 rational strategies; and it shows how smart heuristics can exploit the structure of                 environments.},

In addition, they generalized {CL} to the n-group case, the correlated samples case, and the discrete values case.

	shorttitle = {Pasteur's Quadrant},
	abstract = {Over fifty years ago, Vannevar Bush released his enormously influential report, Science, the Endless Frontier, which asserted a dichotomy between basic and applied science. This view was at the core of the compact between government and science that led to the golden age of scientific research after World War {II}--a compact that is currently under severe stress. In this book, Donald Stokes challenges Bush's view and maintains that we can only rebuild the relationship between government and the scientific community when we understand what is wrong with that view. Stokes begins with an analysis of the goals of understanding and use in scientific research. He recasts the widely accepted view of the tension between understanding and use, citing as a model case the fundamental yet use-inspired studies by which Louis Pasteur laid the foundations of microbiology a century ago. Pasteur worked in the era of the " second industrial revolution, " when the relationship between basic science and technological change assumed its modern form. Over subsequent decades, technology has been increasingly science-based. But science has been increasingly technology-based--with the choice of problems and the conduct of research often inspired by societal needs. An example is the work of the quantum-effects physicists who are probing the phenomena revealed by the miniaturization of semiconductors from the time of the transistor's discovery after World War {II}. On this revised, interactive view of science and technology, Stokes builds a convincing case that by recognizing the importance of use-inspired basic research we can frame a new compact between science and government. His conclusions have majorimplications for both the scientific and policy communities and will be of great interest to those in the broader public who are troubled by the current role of basic science in American democracy.},

A relatively cheap computational cost, referred to as the Morris method, was chosen to assess the relative effects of all parameters on the model’s outputs and to gain insights into predator–prey systems. Structure and results of the sensitivity analysis of the Sumatran tiger model – the Panthera Population Persistence ({PPP}) and the Notonecta foraging model ({NFM}) – were compared. Both models are based on a general predation cycle and designed to understand the mechanisms behind the predator–prey interaction being considered. However, the models differ significantly in their complexity and the details of the processes involved. In the sensitivity analysis, parameters that directly contribute to the number of prey items killed were found to be most influential. These were the growth rate of prey and the hunting radius of tigers in the {PPP} model as well as attack rate parameters and encounter distance of backswimmers in the {NFM} model. Analysis of distances in both of the models revealed further similarities in the sensitivity of the two individual-based models. The findings highlight the applicability and importance of sensitivity analyses in general, and screening design methods in particular, during early development of ecological individual-based models. Comparison of model structures and sensitivity analyses provides a first step for the derivation of general rules in the design of predator–prey models for both practical conservation and conceptual understanding.},

In order to develop effective household demand management programs, water managers need to understand the factors that influence household water use. Following an examination and re-analysis of current water consumption behavioral models we propose a new model for understanding household water consumption. We argue that trust plays a role in household water consumption, since people will not save water if they feel others are not minimizing their water use (inter-personal trust). Furthermore, people are less likely to save water if they do not trust the water authority (institutional trust). This paper proposes that to fully understand the factors involved in determining household water use the impact of trust on water consumption needs investigation.},

We compare our results to a gold-standard data-augmented {MCMC} for both complete and incomplete data. We illustrate our techniques using simulated epidemics as well as data from a recent outbreak of Ebola Haemorrhagic Fever in the Democratic Republic of Congo and discuss situations in which we think simulation-based inference may be preferable to likelihood-based inference.},

Not so well recognized are the circumstances under which normative information can backfire to produce the opposite of what a communicator intends. There is an understandable, but misguided, tendency to try to mobilize action against a problem by depicting it as regrettably frequent. Information campaigns emphasize that alcohol and drug use is intolerably high, that adolescent suicide rates are alarming, and—most relevant to this article—that rampant polluters are spoiling the environment. Although these claims may be both true and well intentioned, the campaigns' creators have missed something critically important: Within the statement “Many people are doing this undesirable thing” lurks the powerful and undercutting normative message “Many people are doing this.” Only by aligning descriptive norms (what people typically do) with injunctive norms (what people typically approve or disapprove) can one optimize the power of normative appeals. Communicators who fail to recognize the distinction between these two types of norms imperil their persuasive efforts.},

Our data set comprises over 46 billion words contained in nearly 4.6 billion expressions posted over a 33 month span by over 63 million unique users. In measuring happiness, we construct a tunable, real-time, remote-sensing, and non-invasive, text-based hedonometer. In building our metric, made available with this paper, we conducted a survey to obtain happiness evaluations of over 10,000 individual words, representing a tenfold size improvement over similar existing word sets. Rather than being ad hoc, our word list is chosen solely by frequency of usage, and we show how a highly robust and tunable metric can be constructed and defended.},

	abstract = {Global methods based on variance decomposition are increasingly being used for sensitivity analysis ({SA}). Of these, analysis of variance ({ANOVA}) is surprisingly rarely employed. Yet, it is a viable alternative to other model-free methods, as it gives comparable results and is readily available in most statistical packages. Furthermore, decomposing the input factors of {ANOVA} into orthogonal polynomial effects gives additional insights into the way a parameter impacts on model output (linear, quadratic and cubic). However, using global methods should not lead modellers to forego local methods, which provide additional information, as, for example, time course analysis of local sensitivity coefficients. We illustrate the use of these techniques, particularly {ANOVA}, on a stochastic individual-based model of a mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) population in experimental tanks. Local {SA} led to unexpected and counter-intuitive results, indicating that the model output (population size) was much more sensitive to the fecundity threshold (length at first parturition) than to the fecundity parameter (brood size). Time course analysis of local coefficients suggested that, as far as calibration is concerned, it would probably be impossible to determine more than two parameters on the sole records of the population size in time. Global {SA} ({ANOVA}) was targeted to assess which processes had an impact on the model outcome in our experimental conditions, by exploring the parameter space over the entire biological range of all parameters. It showed that parameters had mainly linear and additive effects (few interactions) on the output in a logarithmic scale, and that the main processes involved in population growth were individual growth and adult survival, followed by the breeding process. Juvenile survival had a lesser impact.},

His delight as he unveils each surprising discovery is infectious. This book is not merely important; it's fun."--Robert D. Putnam, author of Making Democracy {WorkRobert} Axelrod is widely known for his groundbreaking work in game theory and complexity theory. He is a leader in applying computer modeling to social science problems. His book The Evolution of Cooperation has been hailed as a seminal contribution and has been translated into eight languages since its initial publication. The Complexity of Cooperation is a sequel to that landmark book. It collects seven essays, originally published in a broad range of journals, and adds an extensive new introduction to the collection, along with new prefaces to each essay and a useful new appendix of additional resources. Written in Axelrod's acclaimed, accessible style, this collection serves as an introductory text on complexity theory and computer modeling in the social sciences and as an overview of the current state of the art in the field.The articles move beyond the basic paradigm of the Prisoner's Dilemma to study a rich set of issues, including how to cope with errors in perception or implementation, how norms emerge, and how new political actors and regions of shared culture can develop. They use the shared methodology of agent-based modeling, a powerful technique that specifies the rules of interaction betweenindividuals and uses computer simulation to discover emergent properties of the social system. The Complexity of Cooperation is essential reading for all social scientists who are interested in issues of cooperation and complexity},

We conduct experiments with a larger number of repetitions than in previous work in order to test this prediction. We find that when subjects are given minimal information, only after close to 100 periods do subjects begin to approach equilibrium. In contrast, with full information, subjects learn to play a pure strategy equilibrium relatively quickly. However, the information which permits rapid convergence, revelation of the individual play of all opponents, is not predicted to have any effect by existing models of learning.},

Post meter leakage can account for up to 10\% of total water consumption particularly in the residential sector. Households identified as having post meter leakage were subjected to a mix of basic and tailored information regarding water loss.  The primary aim of the study was to test the effectiveness of communication interventions and the attributed water savings resulting from the repair of household leaks. Moreover, questionnaire surveys were conducted to establish the significant factors, including leak type, demographics and household awareness, to name a few, that will influence the development of a fit-for-purpose post-meter leak rectification policy and program.  The paper concludes with some key recommendations for the development of a predictive model for identifying, classifying, quantifying post meter loss and the least cost planning implications of a leak rectification policy.},

It has the attractive property that it side-steps the need to specify the costs of the different kinds of misclassification. However, the simple form is only applicable to the case of two classes. We extend the definition to the case of more than two classes by averaging pairwise comparisons. This measure reduces to the standard form in the two class case. We compare its properties with the standard measure of proportion correct and an alternative definition of proportion correct based on pairwise comparison of classes for a simple artificial case and illustrate its application on eight data sets. On the data sets we examined, the measures produced similar, but not identical results, reflecting the different aspects of performance that they were measuring. Like the area under the {ROC} curve, the measure we propose is useful in those many situations where it is impossible to give costs for the different kinds of misclassification.},

This paper develops methods of inference which can be used for implicit statistical models whose distribution theory is intractable. The kernel method of probability density estimation is advocated for estimating a log-likelihood from simulations of such a model. The development and testing of an algorithm for maximizing this estimated log-likelihood function is described. An illustrative example involving a stochastic model for quantal response assays is given. Possible applications of the maximization algorithm to ad hoc methods of parameter estimation are noted briefly, and illustrated by an example involving a model for the spatial pattern of displaced amacrine cells in the retina of a rabbit.},

We describe a physically implemented robotic system that applies techniques from artificial intelligence to carry out cycles of scientific experimentation. The system automatically originates hypotheses to explain observations, devises experiments to test these hypotheses, physically runs the experiments using a laboratory robot, interprets the results to falsify hypotheses inconsistent with the data, and then repeats the cycle. Here we apply the system to the determination of gene function using deletion mutants of yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and auxotrophic growth experiments. We built and tested a detailed logical model (involving genes, proteins and metabolites) of the aromatic amino acid synthesis pathway. In biological experiments that automatically reconstruct parts of this model, we show that an intelligent experiment selection strategy is competitive with human performance and significantly outperforms, with a cost decrease of 3-fold and 100-fold (respectively), both cheapest and random-experiment selection.},

	abstract = {Combining or integrating the outputs of several pattern classifiers has led to improved performance in a multitude of applications. This paper provides an analytical framework to quantify the improvements in classification results due to combining. We show that combining networks linearly in output space reduces the variance of the actual decision region boundaries around the optimum boundary. This result is valid under the assumption that the a posteriori probability distributions for each class are locally monotonic around the Bayes optimum boundary. In the absence of classifier bias, the error is shown to be proportional to the boundary variance, resulting in a simple expression for error rate improvements. In the presence of bias, the error reduction, expressed in terms of a bias reduction factor, is shown to be less than or equal to the reduction obtained in the absence of bias. The analysis presented here facilitates the understanding of the relationships among error rates, classifier boundary distributions and combining in output space.},

	abstract = {Spatial models for habitat selection of marsh-breeding bird species were developed using artificial neural networks. The habitat models included single and multiple species artificial neural networks for red-winged blackbird (Agelaius phoeniceus) and marsh wren (Cistothorus palustris). Data for the study came from two diked wetland basins on southwestern Lake Erie, {USA}. The single species artificial neural network model performed better than the logistic regression model except in the presence of interspecific interaction with marsh wren. A multiple species habitat model was developed using data from one basin that included both nesting red-winged blackbirds and marsh wrens. The multiple species neural network model performed better than the logistic regression model in the presence of interspecific interaction and could simultaneously predict the nest locations of both species. Using neural interpretation diagrams, relevances, and sensitivity analyses, we determined the mechanisms of habitat selection in red-winged blackbirds and marsh wrens. Habitat selection in marsh-breeding bird species was a non-linear process that could not be sufficiently understood in terms of general linear models. The non-linear structure of the neural network model not only predicts habitat selection better, but with a critical evaluation through neural interpretation diagrams, relevances and sensitivity analyses can lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms of habitat selection. As predictive tools single species neural network models were too specific in cases where the system changed to include interacting species. In these cases linear models might be better predictors but not necessarily provide a better understanding. In the presence of two interacting species we suggest the use of a neural network model that is trained with a data set from a wetland where all the interacting species are present. In the absence of the interacting species the dynamics will change and habitat selection can be based on an entirely different set of rules and relationships. Therefore, the decision on which neural network model to use must be based on an in-depth understanding of the ecology of the system under study.},

A recently introduced neural network, named word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013a; Mikolov et al., 2013b), was shown to encode semantic information in the direction of the word vectors. In this brief report, it is proposed to use the length of the vectors, together with the term frequency, as measure of word significance in a corpus. Experimental evidence using a domain-specific corpus of abstracts is presented to support this proposal. A useful visualization technique for text corpora emerges, where words are mapped onto a two-dimensional plane and automatically ranked by significance.},

Newspaper articles may lack accuracy, while the severity of findings in scientific papers may be too opaque for the public to understand. Social media, however, is a forum where individuals of diverse backgrounds can share their thoughts and opinions. As consumption shifts from old media to new, Twitter has become a valuable resource for analyzing current events and headline news. In this research, we analyze tweets containing the word “climate” collected between September 2008 and July 2014. Through use of a previously developed sentiment measurement tool called the Hedonometer, we determine how collective sentiment varies in response to climate change news, events, and natural disasters. We find that natural disasters, climate bills, and oil-drilling can contribute to a decrease in happiness while climate rallies, a book release, and a green ideas contest can contribute to an increase in happiness. Words uncovered by our analysis suggest that responses to climate change news are predominately from climate change activists rather than climate change deniers, indicating that Twitter is a valuable resource for the spread of climate change awareness.},

Both discrete-time and continuous-time chains are studied. A distinguishing feature is an introduction to more advanced topics such as martingales and potentials in the established context of Markov chains. There are applications to simulation, economics, optimal control, genetics, queues and many other topics, and exercises and examples drawn both from theory and practice.

They have proven useful in modeling physical systems and have been applied to engineering problems such as wing-design optimization. During human-in-the-loop experimentation, it has become increasingly common to use online platforms, like Mechanical Turk, to run low-fidelity experiments to gather human performance data in an efficient manner. One concern with these experiments is that the results obtained from the online environment generalize poorly to the actual domain of interest. To address this limitation, we extend traditional multi-fidelity approaches to allow us to combine fewer data points from high-fidelity human-in-the-loop experiments with plentiful but less accurate data from low-fidelity experiments to produce accurate models of how humans interact. We present both model-based and model-free methods, and summarize the predictive performance of each method under different conditions.},

	abstract = {Mathematical modelers from different disciplines and regulatory agencies worldwide agree on the importance of a careful sensitivity analysis ({SA}) of model-based inference. The most popular {SA} practice seen in the literature is that of ’one-factor-at-a-time’ ({OAT}). This consists of analyzing the effect of varying one model input factor at a time while keeping all other fixed. While the shortcomings of {OAT} are known from the statistical literature, its widespread use among modelers raises concern on the quality of the associated sensitivity analyses. The present paper introduces a novel geometric proof of the inefficiency of {OAT}, with the purpose of providing the modeling community with a convincing and possibly definitive argument against {OAT}. Alternatives to {OAT} are indicated which are based on statistical theory, drawing from experimental design, regression analysis and sensitivity analysis proper.},

For comparative politics, scholars who are often interested in non-English and possibly multilingual textual datasets, these advances may be difficult to access. This article discusses practical issues that arise in the processing, management, translation, and analysis of textual data with a particular focus on how procedures differ across languages. These procedures are combined in two applied examples of automated text analysis using the recently introduced Structural Topic Model. We also show how the model can be used to analyze data that have been translated into a single language via machine translation tools. All the methods we describe here are implemented in open-source software packages available from the authors.},

	abstract = {In this article, we explore an event detection framework to improve multi-document summarization. Our approach is based on a two-stage single-document method that extracts a collection of key phrases, which are then used in a centrality-as-relevance passage retrieval model. We explore how to adapt this single-document method for multi-document summarization methods that are able to use event information. The event detection method is based on Fuzzy Fingerprint, which is a supervised method trained on documents with annotated event tags. To cope with the possible usage of different terms to describe the same event, we explore distributed representations of text in the form of word embeddings, which contributed to improve the summarization results. The proposed summarization methods are based on the hierarchical combination of single-document summaries. The automatic evaluation and human study performed show that these methods improve upon current state-of-the-art multi-document summarization systems on two mainstream evaluation datasets, {DUC} 2007 and {TAC} 2009. We show a relative improvement in {ROUGE}-1 scores of 16\% for {TAC} 2009 and of 17\% for {DUC} 2007.},

One of the biggest challenges of game theory is the lack of a framework for making predictions and designing markets in a manner that is consistent with the axioms of decision theory. An approach in which solution concepts are distribution-valued rather than set-valued (i.e. equilibrium theory) has both capabilities. We call this approach Predictive Game Theory (or {PGT}). This paper outlines a general Bayesian approach to {PGT}. It also presents one simple example to illustrate the way in which this approach differs from equilibrium approaches in both prediction and mechanism design settings.},

Unfortunately, typical dimensionality reduction methods for text, such as latent Dirichlet allocation, often produce low-dimensional subspaces (topics) that are obviously flawed to human domain experts. The contributions of this paper are threefold: (1) An analysis of the ways in which topics can be flawed; (2) an automated evaluation metric for identifying such topics that does not rely on human annotators or reference collections outside the training data; (3) a novel statistical topic model based on this metric that significantly improves topic quality in a large-scale document collection from the National Institutes of Health ({NIH}).},

	abstract = {Models have become so fashionable that many scientists and engineers cannot imagine working without them. The predominant use of computer codes to execute model calculations has blurred the distinction between code and model. The recent controversy regarding model validation has brought into question what we mean by a ‘model’ and by ‘validation.’ It has become apparent that the usual meaning of validation may be common in engineering practice and seems useful in legal practice but it is contrary to scientific practice and brings into question our understanding of science and how it can best be applied to such problems as hazardous waste characterization, remediation, and aqueous geochemistry in general. This review summarizes arguments against using the phrase model validation and examines efforts to validate models for high-level radioactive waste management and for permitting and monitoring open-pit mines. Part of the controversy comes from a misunderstanding of ‘prediction’ and the need to distinguish logical from temporal prediction. Another problem stems from the difference in the engineering approach contrasted with the scientific approach. The reductionist influence on the way we approach environmental investigations also limits our ability to model the interconnected nature of reality. Guidelines are proposed to improve our perceptions and proper utilization of models. Use of the word ‘validation’ is strongly discouraged when discussing model reliability.},

And the subject of these stories—how small and seemingly meaningless decisions and actions by individuals often lead to significant unintended consequences for a large group—is more important than ever. In one famous example, Thomas C. Schelling shows that a slight-but-not-malicious preference to have neighbors of the same race eventually leads to completely segregated populations. The updated edition of this landmark book contains a new preface and the author's Nobel Prize acceptance speech.},

This paper reports selected findings from the Gold Coast Residential End Use Study (Australia), which focussed on the relationship between a range of socio-demographic and household stock efficiency variables and water end use consumption levels. A mixed methods approach was executed using qualitative and quantitative data. The study provided evidence as to the potential savings derived from efficient appliances as well as socio-demographic clusters having higher water consumption across end uses. The payback period for some water efficient devices was also explored. The study has implications for urban water demand management planning and forecasting.},

	abstract = {Rational choice theory enjoys unprecedented popularity and influence in the behavioral and social sciences, but it generates intractable problems when applied to socially interactive decisions. In individual decisions, instrumental rationality is defined in terms of expected utility maximization. This becomes problematic in interactive decisions, when individuals have only partial control over the outcomes, because expected utility maximization is undefined in the absence of assumptions about how the other participants will behave. Game theory therefore incorporates not only rationality but also common knowledge assumptions, enabling players to anticipate their co-players\&apos; strategies. Under these assumptions, disparate anomalies emerge. Instrumental rationality, conventionally interpreted, fails to explain intuitively obvious features of human interaction, yields predictions starkly at variance with experimental findings, and breaks down completely in certain cases. In particular, focal point selection in pure coordination games is inexplicable, though it is easily achieved in practice; the intuitively compelling payoff-dominance principle lacks rational justification; rationality in social dilemmas is self-defeating; a key solution concept for cooperative coalition games is frequently inapplicable; and rational choice in certain sequential games generates contradictions. In experiments, human players behave more cooperatively and receive higher payoffs than strict rationality would permit. Orthodox conceptions of rationality are evidently internally deficient and inadequate for explaining human interaction. Psychological game theory, based on nonstandard assumptions, is required to solve these problems, and some suggestions along these lines have already been put forward.},

Fundamentals-based forecasts are relatively expensive to construct, an attribute the academic literature frequently ignores, and update slowly over time, constraining their accuracy. However, fundamentals provide valuable insights into the relationship between key indicators for nominated movies and their chances of victory. For instance, we find that the performance in other awards shows is highly predictive of the Oscar victory whereas box office results are not. Polling- based forecasts have the potential to be both accurate and timely. Timeliness requires incentives for frequent responses by high-information users. Accuracy is achieved by a proper transformation of raw polls. Prediction market prices are accurate forecasts, but can be further improved by simple transformations of raw prices, yielding the most accurate forecasts in our study. Expert forecasts exhibit some characteristics of fundamental models, but are generally not comparatively accurate or timely. This study is unique in both comparing and aggregating four traditional data sources, and considering critical attributes beyond accuracy. We believe that the results of this study generalize to many other domains.},

	abstract = {Probabilistic forecasts are becoming more and more available. How should they be used and communicated? What are the obstacles to their use in practice? I review experience with five problems where probabilistic forecasting played an important role. This leads me to identify five types of potential users: Low Stakes Users, who don't need probabilistic forecasts; General Assessors, who need an overall idea of the uncertainty in the forecast; Change Assessors, who need to know if a change is out of line with expectatations; Risk Avoiders, who wish to limit the risk of an adverse outcome; and Decision Theorists, who quantify their loss function and perform the decision-theoretic calculations. This suggests that it is important to interact with users and to consider their goals. The cognitive research tells us that calibration is important for trust in probability forecasts, and that it is important to match the verbal expression with the task. The cognitive load should be minimized, reducing the probabilistic forecast to a single percentile if appropriate. Probabilities of adverse events and percentiles of the predictive distribution of quantities of interest seem often to be the best way to summarize probabilistic forecasts. Formal decision theory has an important role, but in a limited range of applications.},

	abstract = {The output of a classifier should be a calibrated posterior probability to enable post-processing. Standard {SVMs} do not provide such probabilities. One method to create probabilities is to directly train a kernel classifier with a logit link function and a regularized maximum likelihood score. However, training with a maximum likelihood score will produce non-sparse kernel machines. Instead, we train an {SVM}, then train the parameters of an additional sigmoid function to map the {SVM} outputs into probabilities. This chapter compares classification error rate and likelihood scores for an {SVM} plus sigmoid versus a kernel method trained with a regularized likelihood error function. These methods are tested on three data-mining-style data sets. The {SVM}+sigmoid yields probabilities of comparable quality to the regularized maximum likelihood kernel method, while still retaining the sparseness of the {SVM}.},

Although many such rules have been developed, relatively little guidance exists as to which rule is the most appropriate. In this paper, we discuss two important properties of quadratic, spherical, and logarithmic scoring rules. From an ex post perspective, we compare their rank order properties and conclude that both quadratic and spherical scoring perform poorly in this regard, relative to logarithmic. Second, from an ex ante perspective, we demonstrate that in many situations, logarithmic scoring is the method least affected by a nonlinear utility function. These results suggest that logarithmic scoring is superior when rank order results are important and/or when the assessor has a nonlinear utility function. In addition to these results, and perhaps more important, we demonstrate that nonlinear utility induces relatively little deviation from the optimal assessment under an assumption of risk neutrality. These results provide both comfort and guidance to those who would like to use scoring rules as part of the assessment process.},

The book focuses on both theoretical and empirical aspects. The theoretical sections explore the important and characteristic properties of the basic {GA} as well as main characteristics of the selected algorithmic extensions developed by the authors. In the empirical parts of the text, the authors apply {GAs} to two combinatorial optimization problems: the traveling salesman and capacitated vehicle routing problems. To highlight the properties of the algorithmic measures in the field of {GP}, they analyze {GP}-based nonlinear structure identification applied to time series and classification problems.   Written by core members of the {HeuristicLab} team, this book provides a better understanding of the basic workflow of {GAs} and {GP}, encouraging readers to establish new bionic, problem-independent theoretical concepts. By comparing the results of standard {GA} and {GP} implementation with several algorithmic extensions, it also shows how to substantially increase achievable solution quality.},

Scholars have long recognized this, but the massive costs of analyzing even moderately sized collections of texts have hindered their use in political science research. Here lies the promise of automated text analysis: it substantially reduces the costs of analyzing large collections of text. We provide a guide to this exciting new area of research and show how, in many instances, the methods have already obtained part of their promise. But there are pitfalls to using automated methods—they are no substitute for careful thought and close reading and require extensive and problem-specific validation. We survey a wide range of new methods, provide guidance on how to validate the output of the models, and clarify misconceptions and errors in the literature. To conclude, we argue that for automated text methods to become a standard tool for political scientists, methodologists must contribute new methods and new methods of validation.},

We analyze to what extent the theoretically crucial distinction of finite versus infinite-horizon games is reflected in the outcomes of a prisoner’s dilemma experiment. We compare three different experimental termination rules in four treatments: a known finite end, an unknown end, and two variants with a random termination rule (with a high and with a low continuation probability, where cooperation can occur in a subgame-perfect equilibrium only with the high probability). We find that the termination rules do not significantly affect average cooperation rates. Specifically, employing a random termination rule does not cause significantly more cooperation compared to a known finite horizon, and the continuation probability does not significantly affect average cooperation rates either. However, the termination rules may influence cooperation over time and end-game behavior. Further, the (expected) length of the game significantly increases cooperation rates. The results suggest that subjects may need at least some learning opportunities (like repetitions of the supergame) before significant backward induction arguments in finitely repeated game have force.},

	abstract = {Land use, land use change and forestry ({LULUCF}) can play a positive role in mitigating global warming by sequestering carbon from the atmosphere into vegetation and soils. Local entities (e.g. local government, community, stockholders) have been making great efforts in enhancing carbon sequestration ({CS}) of local forests for mitigating global climate change and participating in international carbon-trade promoted by the Kyoto Protocol. Approaches and tools are needed to assess the enhancement of {CS} through land use changes and proper policy decisions. This paper presents an integrated assessment framework and a spatial decision support system ({IA}-{SDSS}) as a tool to support land-use planning and local forestry development with consideration of {CS}. The {IA}-{SDSS} integrates two process-based carbon models, a spatial decision ({EMDS}) module, a spatial cost-benefit analysis ({CBA}) module, and the analytic hierarchy process ({AHP}) module. It can provide spatially explicit {CS} information as well as {CS}-induced economic benefits under various scenarios of the carbon credit market. A case study conducted in Liping County, Guizhou Province, China demonstrated that the {IA}-{SDSS} developed in this study is applicable in supporting decision-making on ‘where’ and ‘how’ to adopt forestry land use options in favor of {CS}.},

Due to recent declines in {MAM} rainfall, increases in population, land degradation, and limited technological advances, this region has become a recent epicenter of food insecurity. Timely and skillful precipitation forecasts for {EA} could help decision makers better manage their limited resources, mitigate socio-economic losses, and potentially save human lives. The ‘hybrid approach’ described in this study uses the {CA} method to translate dynamical precipitation and sea surface temperature ({SST}) forecasts over the Indian and Pacific Oceans (specifically 30°S to 30°N and 30°E to 270°E) into terrestrial {MAM} precipitation forecasts over the {EA} region. In doing so, this approach benefits from the post-1999 teleconnection that exists between precipitation and {SSTs} over the Indian and tropical Pacific Oceans (Indo-Pacific) and {EA} {MAM} rainfall. The coupled atmosphere-ocean dynamical forecasts used in this study were drawn from the {NMME}. We demonstrate that while the {MAM} precipitation forecasts (initialized in February) skill of the {NMME} models over the {EA} region itself is negligible, the ranked probability skill score of hybrid {CA} forecasts based on Indo-Pacific {NMME} precipitation and {SST} forecasts reach up to 0.45.},

	abstract = {Extensive exploration of simulation models comes at a high computational cost, all the more when the model involves a lot of parameters. Economists usually rely on random explorations, such as Monte Carlo simulations, and basic econometric modeling to approximate the properties of computational models. This paper aims to provide guidelines for the use of a much more efficient method that combines a parsimonious sampling of the parameter space using a specific design of experiments ({DoE}), with a well-suited metamodeling method first developed in geostatistics: kriging. We illustrate these guidelines by following them in the analysis of two simple and well known economic models: Nelson and Winter’s industrial dynamics model, and Cournot oligopoly with learning firms. In each case, we show that our {DoE} experiments can catch the main effects of the parameters on the models’ dynamics with a much lower number of simulations than the Monte-Carlo sampling (e.g. 85 simulations instead of 2,000 in the first case). In the analysis of the second model, we also introduce supplementary numerical tools that may be combined with this method, for characterizing configurations complying with a specific criterion (social optimal, replication of stylized facts, etc.). Our appendix gives an example of the R-project code that can be used to apply this method on other models, in order to encourage other researchers to quickly test this approach on their models.},

	abstract = {There is now substantial literature describing the importance of home gardens for a variety of quality of life variables such as avoidance of stress, recreation and personal and social identity. From a water resource management perspective it is reasonable to hypothesise that those households that gain the most personal benefits from their gardens will use more water. Consideration of the relationship between quality of life and external water use needs to be made if policies in relation to demand management, supply reliability and restrictions are to reflect community values adequately. In this study, estimates were made of external water use, the total water use outside home (e.g. on lawns, gardens, or swimming pools) for 397 households in detached housing in Perth, {WA}. Measurements were made of a variety of socio-demographic variables which may affect water use. These included income, block size, swimming pool ownership and so on. In addition five latent attitudinal or quality of life variables were measured. These were the importance of garden and natural space for personal lifestyle satisfaction, interest in gardening, attitudes towards the garden as a source of recreation, attitudes to water conservation and a social desirability scale. External water use was modelled using structural equations with the latent variables. The expected socio-demographic variables such as block size or swimming pool ownership were found to influence water use. Lifestyle, garden interest and garden recreation activities were found to be related but all had a direct influence on external water use. Attitudes towards water conservation unlike previous studies also directly affected external usage. It appeared that the interaction between attitudinal and socio-demographic influences were minimal on external water use. The significance of these findings for evaluating the performance of water utilities on the social dimension of sustainability is discussed. Finally, the need for appropriate specificity in attitudinal and water use measurement in demand prediction studies is highlighted.},

Importantly, ties in these networks often are dynamic, changing in response to the behavior of one's social partners. This dynamic structure permits an important form of conditional action that has been explored theoretically but has received little empirical attention: People can respond to the cooperation and defection of those around them by making or breaking network links. Here, we present experimental evidence of the power of using strategic link formation and dissolution, and the network modification it entails, to stabilize cooperation in sizable groups. Our experiments explore large-scale cooperation, where subjects’ cooperative actions are equally beneficial to all those with whom they interact. Consistent with previous research, we find that cooperation decays over time when social networks are shuffled randomly every round or are fixed across all rounds. We also find that, when networks are dynamic but are updated only infrequently, cooperation again fails. However, when subjects can update their network connections frequently, we see a qualitatively different outcome: Cooperation is maintained at a high level through network rewiring. Subjects preferentially break links with defectors and form new links with cooperators, creating an incentive to cooperate and leading to substantial changes in network structure. Our experiments confirm the predictions of a set of evolutionary game theoretic models and demonstrate the important role that dynamic social networks can play in supporting large-scale human cooperation.},

	abstract = {A stochastic individual-based model called {COSMOS} was developed to simulate the epidemiology of banana weevil Cosmopolites sordidus, a major pest of banana fields. The model is based on simple rules of local movement of adults, egg laying of females, development and mortality, and infestation of larvae inside the banana plants. The biological parameters were estimated from the literature, and the model was validated at the small-plot scale. Simulated and observed distributions of attacks were similar except for five plots out of 18, using a Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. These exceptions may be explained by variation in predation of eggs and measurement error. An exhaustive sensitivity analysis using the Morris method showed that predation rate of eggs, demographic parameters of adults and mortality rate of larvae were the most influential parameters. {COSMOS} was therefore used to test different spatial arrangements of banana plants on the epidemiology of C. sordidus. Planting bananas in groups increased the time required to colonise plots but also the percentage of banana plants with severe attacks. Spatial heterogeneity of banana stages had no effect on time required to colonise plots but increased the mean level of attacks. Our model helps explain key factors of population dynamics and the epidemiology of this tropical pest.},

This manuscript describes a procedure to estimate the probability of experiencing an end-of-season biomass production deficit during the on-going season based on a statistical analysis of Earth Observation data. A 15-year time series of the Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation from the {SPOT}-{VEGETATION} instrument is used to characterize the climatological development of vegetation, its variability and its current status. Forecasts of overall seasonal performances, expressed in terms of the probability of experiencing a critical deficit at the end of the growing season, are updated regularly whenever a new satellite observation is made available. Results and performances of the method are discussed for croplands and pastures in the Sahel.},

	abstract = {The aim of this book is to discuss the fundamental ideas which lie behind the statistical theory of learning and generalization. It considers learning as a general problem of function estimation based on empirical data. Omitting proofs and technical details, the author concentrates on discussing the main results of learning theory and their connections to fundamental problems in statistics. These include: * the setting of learning problems based on the model of minimizing the risk functional from empirical data * a comprehensive analysis of the empirical risk minimization principle including necessary and sufficient conditions for its consistency * non-asymptotic bounds for the risk achieved using the empirical risk minimization principle * principles for controlling the generalization ability of learning machines using small sample sizes based on these bounds * the Support Vector methods that control the generalization ability when estimating function using small sample size. The second edition of the book contains three new chapters devoted to further development of the learning theory and {SVM} techniques. These include: * the theory of direct method of learning based on solving multidimensional integral equations for density, conditional probability, and conditional density estimation * a new inductive principle of learning. Written in a readable and concise style, the book is intended for statisticians, mathematicians, physicists, and computer scientists. Vladimir N. Vapnik is Technology Leader {AT}\&T Labs-Research and Professor of London University. He is one of the founders of statistical learning theory, and the author of seven books published in English, Russian, German, and Chinese.},

This breakthrough has been hailed as a way to fundamentally change science and engineering by letting people perform experiments that were previously beyond reach. But for those interested in exploring the I/O behavior of their simulation model, efficient experimental design has a much higher payoff at a much lower cost. A well-designed experiment allows the analyst to examine many more factors than would otherwise be possible, while providing insights that cannot be gleaned from trial-and-error approaches or by sampling factors one at a time. We present the basic concepts of experimental design, the types of goals it can address, and why it is such an important and useful tool for simulation. Ideally, this tutorial will entice you to use experimental designs in your upcoming simulation studies.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.2944},
	abstract = {Machine learning algorithms frequently require careful tuning of model hyperparameters, regularization terms, and optimization parameters. Unfortunately, this tuning is often a "black art" that requires expert experience, unwritten rules of thumb, or sometimes brute-force search. Much more appealing is the idea of developing automatic approaches which can optimize the performance of a given learning algorithm to the task at hand. In this work, we consider the automatic tuning problem within the framework of Bayesian optimization, in which a learning algorithm's generalization performance is modeled as a sample from a Gaussian process ({GP}). The tractable posterior distribution induced by the {GP} leads to efficient use of the information gathered by previous experiments, enabling optimal choices about what parameters to try next. Here we show how the effects of the Gaussian process prior and the associated inference procedure can have a large impact on the success or failure of Bayesian optimization. We show that thoughtful choices can lead to results that exceed expert-level performance in tuning machine learning algorithms. We also describe new algorithms that take into account the variable cost (duration) of learning experiments and that can leverage the presence of multiple cores for parallel experimentation. We show that these proposed algorithms improve on previous automatic procedures and can reach or surpass human expert-level optimization on a diverse set of contemporary algorithms including latent Dirichlet allocation, structured {SVMs} and convolutional neural networks.},

There has been less research however, investigating whether this bias is related to specific categories of end use and/or specific types of socio-demographic and socio-psychological household profiles. A high resolution smart metering study producing a detailed end use event registry as well as psycho-social and socio-demographic surveys, stock inventory audits and self-reported water diaries was completed for 252 households located in South-east Queensland, Australia. The study examined the contributions of end uses to total water use for each group that self-identified as “low”, “medium” or “high” water users. A series of univariate tests (i.e. analysis of variance) were conducted to examine a range of variables that characterise each self-identified water usage group including age, income, percentage of water efficient stock (e.g. low-flow taps), family size and composition and water conservation intentions and attitudes. The level of information consumers receive on their water bill as well as the diurnal end use patterns were also examined. The paper concludes with a discussion of the general characteristics (i.e. income, age, gender and family composition) of groups that tended to overestimate or underestimate their water use and how this knowledge can be used to inform demand management policy such as targeted community education programmes and community-based social marketing. Further, the potential for positive economic and sustainable development outcomes from this research is also discussed.},

We construct predictive models of whether a bill will survive committee, starting with a strong, novel baseline that uses features of the bill's sponsor and the committee it is referred to. We augment the model with information from the contents of bills, comparing different hypotheses about how a committee decides a bill's fate. These models give significant reductions in prediction error and highlight the importance of bill substance in explanations of policy-making and agenda-setting.},

We created an experimental-data driven agent-based model where the endogenous link between interaction outcome and social structure formation was examined starting from heterogeneous agent behaviour. By testing various social structure configurations, we showed that dynamic networks lead to more cooperation when agents can create more links and reduce exploitation opportunities by free riders. Furthermore, we found that the endogenous network formation was more important for cooperation than the type of network. Our results cast serious doubt about the static view of network structures on cooperation and can provide new insights into market efficiency.},
