This is code for an agent-based model (ABM) of a climate prediction market in which traders adapt their belief about the climate based on the monetary performance of their neighboring traders in a social network. The ABM is meant to test whether climate prediction markets foster the convergence of peopleâ€™s beliefs about the climate.
