This is code for an ABM of a climate prediction market
in which traders adapt their belief about the climate based
on the monetary performance of their neighboring traders in
a social network. The ABM is meant to test whether climate
prediction markets foster the convergence of peopleâ€™s beliefs
about the climate. The model will be used to
assess whether such convergence is impacted by factors such
as the initial belief-homophily in the social network or the
time horizon at which climate securities are realized.

Here is a snapshot of the model's network of agents at an intialization:

The colors of the nodes correspond to different beliefs about the climate.
